Not enough proper execution for the Suns tonight in Philly: arizonasports.com/story/3537585/…

#76ers 112 #Suns 100 Final
"Home Grayson Allen: 17.3 PPG, 3.3 APG, 17-29 FG, 12-19 3P
Road Grayson Allen: 4.7 PPG, 2.7 APG, 5-19 FG, 4-14 3P"
"Final: PHI 112, PHX 100
Durant: 31 Pts, 7 Reb, 2 Blk, 9-20 FG
Gordon: 13 Pts, 6-15 FG
Nurkic: 11-9-5
Embiid: 26 Pts, 11 Reb, 9-18 FG"
"Probably time to take/beg/drag Kevin Durant out of this game. Already at 36 minutes, this one is over, and the Suns have the back-to-back tomorrow"
Metu seeing action. #Suns #76ers
"Margin for error is slim with Devin Booker and Bradley Beal out. The Suns cut down on the turnovers, but the execution and shot-making just wasn't up to par"
"Maxey 3 over Durant.

#Suns down 104-86 with 5:03 left in the game. #76ers"
"Not sure what the coverage was Paul Reed, a power forward/center caught the ball at the FT line and Watanabe was the defender straight on.

Durant was a little to the side and Eubanks was the same on the other side.

Reed scores on a drive at Watanabe. #Suns timeout. 6:10 left."
Good effort by the Suns but they've gotta be sharp in their execution too without Booker/Beal and that looks tough to do right now for a new group this early.
Kevin Durant has 12 of the Suns' 22 FTAs. Just willing the Suns into this game on the offensive end right now
"Flopping technical foul on Drew Eubanks.

#Suns down 88-80 with 9:19 left."
"End of 3Q: PHI 80, PHX 75
Durant: 22 Pts, 6 Reb, 2 Blk, 8-16 FG
Gordon: 13 Pts, 6-12 FG
Eubanks: 10-5-4-1-1
Embiid: 26 Pts, 11 Reb, 9-18 FG"
"Embiid 3 to end quarter. 

#Suns down five, 80-75. #76ers"
Suns cut lead to two. On 17-5 run. #Suns #76ers
"Really nice response from the Suns after they went down 12. Still missing 3s and layups, but they're scratching and clawing their way back into this game. Currently within 5 after an 11-2 run"
Suns still playing hard through a real grind to find any rhythm. Have cut the deficit down to 5. Philly not putting 'em away.
Nurkic on the baseline for two. #Suns down 74-67.
"Looks like Jusuf Nurkic is all right, checking back in here at the 4:40 mark of the 3Q"
Nurkic checks back in. #Suns #76ers
"Embiid starting to eat. 

Has 21 points, nine rebounds. #Suns down 14. #76ers"
All those misses in the first half feel like a missed opportunity for the Suns. Sixers look more awake to start the 2nd half and have stretched the lead to 12
"Tsunami Papi up to 20 points on 8-for-11 shooting.

Sixers now up 12."
Drew Eubanks is starting the second half. Wonder if Nurk is still reeling from that elbow to the face
Eubanks starting 2nd half for Nurkic. #Suns
"Keita Bates-Diop to the rim.

1st points on just two FGAs in his first start with the Suns.

Down 52-45 at the half as Durant leads Phoenix with 14 points. Oubre Jr. pacing Philadelphia with 17. #76ers #Suns"
Pretty good defensive half. Any semblance of shot-making and the Suns would be in the driver's seat. They are not. Down 7.
"Halftime: PHI 52, PHX 45
Durant: 14 Pts, 4 Reb, 4-9 FG
Gordon: 9 Pts, 4-9 FG
Nurkic: 7-4-3, 3-10 FG
Oubre: 17 Pts, 7-10 FG"
"Suns have missed 4 FTs, are 5-of-19 from 3-point range and have missed several shots around the rim. Still somehow down 4. They need to capitalize on that and make this a game before Philly turns it on and blows their lead open"
Phoenix Suns: Devin Booker (ankle) out for Saturday's game at 76ers after return #Suns #76ers azcentral.com/story/sports/n… via @azcentral
Suns are a few bunnies and wide-open 3s going in away from having a decent lead in this one.
Damn. That Joel Embiid elbow to Jusuf Nurkic's face looked rough on replay
"Nurkic missed three straight shots in the paint over th course of two possessions that were contested by Oubre (missed dunk) and Joel Embiid.

#Suns down 43-37. #76ers"
"Suns down 43-36 as Keita Bates-Diop has taken only one shot in eight minutes of action. 

Suns current lineup: Durant, Bates-Diop, Okogie, Allen and Nurkic. #Suns"
Devin Booker (ankle) OUT today after making return Thursday following three-game absence with left ankle sprain suffered late in seaaon opener. #Suns pic.twitter.com/jGKCeZ19ED
"(Not as relevant during regular-season basketball, but one of the reasons I think Okogie is still your best option as the 5th starter is having him/Goodwin play together off the bench really cramps your spacing. Don't think both are playable when that's the case"
Bad execution by the Suns with numbers on the break today. A few where they aren't pushing/spacing well enough and then just some bad misses at the rim.
#Suns down 25-24 after one. #76ers
"End of 1Q: PHI 25, PHX 24
Durant: 8 Pts, 2-6 FG
Gordon: 7 Pts, 3-4 FG
Nurkic: 5-2-2, 2-5 FG
Embiid: 9 Pts, 3 Reb"
"Nurkic 3 with Embiid giving a slight contest.

Pointed to bench.

Nurkic five points, two rebounds, two assists and and no fouls.

Embiid six points, three rebounds, one assist and no fouls. #Suns down 22-20 late in 1st quarter. #76ers"
"Good start structurally for the Suns defense after a rough showing on Thursday. Helping a lot like you have to against Philly and the rotations have been solid.

Offense looks good when it can go off misses."
Gonna give it a few more games but might be time to have the 3PA conversation with Nurk
"Kevin Durant was having conversation with referee after going to the deck as Kelly Oubre Jr. was called for his 2nd foul.

Oubre walked past the conversation and had a couple of words to share. 

Suns down 15-14 as Devin Booker (ankle) and Bradley Beal (back) OUT. #Suns #76ers"

"Good ball movement early, but the Suns have gotta find a way to bring Phoenix Grayson Allen with them on the road"
