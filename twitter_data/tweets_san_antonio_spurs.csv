I will have an immense amount of respect for Kansas State if they go for it here.
I‚Äôve never seen Texas‚Äô kicker Shaun White miss a field goal
Kevin Durant: No longer the only Longhorn to blow a 20-point lead with me in the building this week.
"My week:

Sunday: Wemby in LA
Tuesday: Wemby in PHX
Wednesday: World Series Game 5
Thursday: Wemby in PHX II
Saturday: Whatever this is in Austin."
Lucky ass Longhorns
The old potions and elixirs of the ancient purple wizard might finally be wearing off.
Kansas State always makes you wanna throw something through a window. No matter the coach or players or time of day. They just always bleep things up regardless of how good you are.
"I‚Äôm going back to last season thinking about all the tanking complaints and criticism of banking on a 14 percent chance to get Wembanyama. If you didn‚Äôt get it before, you see now why that was justifiable. More teams should‚Äôve tanked. Even a 14 percent chance is worth it."
"Devin Vassell is day to day with a mild left groin strain, but he is likely to miss Sunday's game against Toronto.

Ready to take up some of Vassell's scoring slack is Malaki Branham, who started 32 games as a rookie last season.

Spurs say Devin Vassell has a mild left groin strain. He is considered day-to-day but will likely miss tomorrow's game vs Toronto
"Here in Austin, working on a Sunday column comparing Maalik Murphy to Victor Wembanyama."

Can‚Äôt wait to see Jokic vs Wembanyama. Not sure they‚Äôll guard one another more than a handful of times but talk about a clash of styles.
The courts with the solid colors on the outside are brutal on television. But the good news is the In-Season Tournament can only go up from here.
"Mavs were bound to play a good team at some point, so this kind of challenge was expected. Pretty good response honestly. Denver is very, very good."
"I‚Äôve been a vocal proponent of the In-Season Tournament and still am, but some of these courts are beyond f‚Äî(bleeped)"

"In a stunning performance that showcased all of his remarkable skills, Victor Wembanyama scored 20 of his 38 points in the first half, and then made sure in the final frame that the Spurs withstood a furious comeback bid by Phoenix to grab a 132-121 win.

"In 4 crunch time games, where the Spurs are 3-1, Wemby is shooting 7/10 from the floor and 7/9 from the free throw line."
"And finally, through 5 games this season off the bench, Cedi Osman is making anything and everything all over the floor: pic.twitter.com/EdPjOWB7xT"
"Zach Collins shooting the ball through 5 games this season:

Whether it's finishing with a jump hook or putting the ball on the floor and finishing at the rim, Zach has been efficient inside. pic.twitter.com/pLuAMllC4a"
"Jeremy Sochan shooting the ball through 5 games this season:

Area to watch is that non-restricted area shot. He's been going to that shot when he posts players in the paint to shoot over them. It went in a few times last night.

He's also finishing well at the rim pic.twitter.com/zjRzmbfSNn"
"Devin Vassell shooting the ball through the first 5 games of the season: 

Vassell has been efficient from all three levels. When he does attack at the closest point to the rim, he's made 11/12 of those attempts.

Of course defenses don't leave him open much from three pic.twitter.com/bjiR9YGtpw"
"Wemby's first 5 games of his career shooting the ball:

- As expected, quite efficient in the paint.
- He's attempted 8 pull-up 3s. Just 1 shy of Vassell (team leader). Wemby is 7'3""
- Last night he logged his first wide open 3-point attempts of the season. Made 2/3 of them. pic.twitter.com/QCZLiWWsBZ"

My fave thing about YouTube is really enjoying something I‚Äôm watching and then getting smashed in the face with ads for 30 seconds. And then going through that process all over again two minutes later. And then being prompted to pay $16/month so I don‚Äôt have to see ads anymore.
The San Antonio Spurs got 38 points from rookie Victor Wembanyama to defeat the Phoenix Suns for the second straight game: spurstalk.com/2023-spurs-sun‚Ä¶
"As a 10th-year pro, Doug McDermott has pretty much seen it all.

But that hasn‚Äôt stopped him from ‚Äútrying to steal‚Äù some stuff from Victor Wembanyama‚Äôs training regimen.

‚ÄúWe can all become better pros just by watching Victor as a first-year guy.‚Äù #Spurs

"Wemby: *leads the Spurs to a third consecutive title

Stephen A: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what, it‚Äôs a lotta hype but I‚Äôm gonna tell you RIGHT NOW‚Ä¶ this Wembayana can HOOP y‚Äôall‚Äù"
Keita Bates-Diop was so good last night. Suns are gonna eventually realize what they have in that dude.
"Victor Wembanyama was simply dominant in the fifth game of his NBA career. Here‚Äôs his highlights from last nights Spurs win over Phoenix‚Ä¶38 pts, 10 rebs, 2 blocks. He‚Äôs only 19 years old! #GoSpursGo #PorVida pic.twitter.com/Qaahea8SOJ"
"Wemby is already among the most talented and impactful players in the world at 19.

I sincerely believe he‚Äôs gonna have one of the best rookie seasons in NBA history, go to the All-Star game and lead the Spurs back to the playoffs this year.

"Parting thought is, the internet will tell you you‚Äôre glazin but you‚Äôre not (maybe the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever typed). I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre gonna defend Wemby w/o an all-world defender of a similar size while also being able to deal with the four other players on the court."
My thoughts after tonight: open.substack.com/chat/posts/217‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/5EqtjM9NSJ
"In a historic performance, Wembanyama had 38 pts & 10 rebs in another win over the Suns. And he‚Äôs hungry for more.

""It just makes me want to go even higher to beat all these record,"" he said.

3 takeaways included a look at Sochan gaining traction at PG.
