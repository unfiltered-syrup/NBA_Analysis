"Precious Achiuwa (left groin strain) listed as doubtful vs. Spurs tomorrow. He participated in 5v5 scrimmage after practice in San Antonio this afternoon, so maybe some optimism if he's symptom free tomorrow (Sunday), otherwise seems like a good bet to return Wed. vs. Dallas."
Achiuwa listed as doubtful again for tomorrow‚Äôs matinee in San Antonio.

Djokovic went a bit possum at the start of the second set and then dug in deeper and deeper as it progressed. Third set looking like a routine one.
"Rublev has made good progress in the H2H with Djokovic and you can see the belief has increased too, earned that set."

The in-season tournament has given us all something to complain about. The NBA hasn't done something this selfless and pure in a long time. Just be thankful.

I love the young nucleus of the Thunder.

"The Smith and Jones VLOG lives on IG.
----------

The #Raptors open their 4 game road trip with a loss in Philly.  Let's break it down, @Paul__Jones.

Raptors fall to Sixers for second time already as Embiid dominates  torontosun.com/sports/basketb‚Ä¶
"Most assists for a Raptors player through the first 6 games of a season:

1. Mark Jackson, 69 (2000)
2. Kyle Lowry, 62 (2018)
3. Jose Calderon, 60 (2011)
4. Dennis Schroder, 56 (2023)

Only Jackson has recorded more assists in his first 6 games with the franchise."
get some rest and get back at it sunday
"Solid effort in the 2nd game of a b2b on the road vs a good Sixers team, but Raps fall to 2-4. After 6 games in 9 days to open the season, bit of a reprieve coming in the sked. Next 6 games come in span of 18 days. Couple days off before getting their 1st look at Wemby on Sunday."
"Bench clearing time, this one's over. Off to San Antonio tomorrow for Sunday's first live look at this Wemby fellow"
Embiid has attempted more free throws (13) than the entire Raptors starting lineup (11).
"Anunoby has done an admirable job battling with the bigger Embiid, as he usually does. Still, it's interesting that Rajakovic has opted against tethering Poeltl's minutes to Embiid's. Tough to match his physicality without Poeltl out there (or Achiuwa/Koloko)."
Sixers by a dozen with 5 1/2 to go; Raptors are just okay when they need to be very good
"If the ref gets the call right, they wouldn‚Äôt have to give out a bogus tech."
that was so blatant from korkmaz too how do you miss that
"Gotta close quarters, man. Sixers closed the 2nd Q on a 10-2 run, closed the 3rd on a 15-4 run. Subtract those 7ish minutes and the Raptors would be up by 6 points. Instead, they go into the 4th trailing by 13 - their largest deficit of the night."
gonna have to find some different bench combos coz this ain't it
"Raptors down 13 going to the fourth, what had been a pretty impressive defence is a bit less than that tonight"
Oubre melting the Raptors resolve with his dreamy eyes.
Flynn has to stop getting picked. Job 1.
"Last season, Scottie Barnes scored 20+ points once in his first 15 games. He's done it in 5 of the first 6 games to open this season."
"For a team with no halfcourt offence, Raptors have a quite passable halfcourt offence tonight"
"Oubre called for the flop technical, first one we've seen this season"
"Nothing about Scottie‚Äôs jumper looks flukey or streaky. Great balance, fluid release. Impressive."
"Solid half, for the most part, but the Raptors couldn't close it out. Sixers go into the break on a 20-8 run and with a 9pt lead. Nurse has this Philly team playing HARD. Very different level of focus/effort than the Raps faced vs the surprisingly disinterested Bucks last night."
I guess Poeltl is just supposed to jump out of the way when Embiid veers to barrel into him?
"Tough last few minutes for the Raptors, down 9 at halftime"

"This is such a wild Raptors list: Heading into today Dennis Schroder is one of five Raptors with at least three double-doubles in his first five games with the club. Everyone would guess Damon Stoudamire, but how many would have Shawn Marion, Precious Achiuwa or Kevin Willis?"
