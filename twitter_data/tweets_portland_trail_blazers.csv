Add it to the reel @ShaedonSharpe. Love how Kennard holds the followthrough before realizing the ball is going in the wrong direction. pic.twitter.com/JZKzhxim3d

"‚ÄúI looked at the box score, saw 46 (minutes) so I had to ask how many minutes are in a game because I was confused.‚Äù ‚Äî @ShaedonSharpe"
"Grant on Sharpe in postgame interview w/ Brooke:
‚ÄúHe makes winning plays.‚Äù

He certainly does- coming up big w/ the free throws to tie it & the block at end of regulation, his step back three in OT. Looking forward to seeing an even more aggressive Sharpe as the season goes along"
"BLAZERS IN-SEASON TOURNEY OT WIN ‚úÖ  

IN-SEASON TOURNEY FAN RIGHT HERE üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Blazers 115, Grizzlies 113: FINAL in OT. 26 points, 8 rebounds for @JeramiGrant. 24 points, 10 assists, 7 rebounds, 3 steals for Malcolm Brogdon. 22 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steal/HUGE block for @ShaedonSharpe. 16 points, 12 rebounds, 3 steals for @DeandreAyton."
Chauncey got a towel around his neck like a boxer
"Grizzlies out of sorts with Smart running the point, end up not really getting a shot, Blazers get the ball, Brogdon gets fouled... misses the first... makes the second. Blazers 113,  Grizzlies 108, 24.9 seconds to play in OT."
Grant got another chance at 3 and wasn‚Äôt bout to miss that one üëåüëåüëå
"Blazers work it around, Brogdon finds Grant wide open for three... and it's good. Blazers 112, Grizzlies 108, 39.0 seconds to play in OT."
"No moment will ever be too big for Shaedon, he just don't care"
OT in the MUD
SHAEDON!!
"Blazers 102, Grizzlies 102: end of regulation. Shaedon Sharpe swats Luke Kennard's three attempt into the fifth row after making two clutch free throws to tie the game."
SHAEDON SWATS THAT OVERTIME
Sharpe tying this game with his calm demeanor this time at the charity stripe
"Shaedon at the line to shoot two... makes the first... and the second. Grizzlies 102, Blazers 102: 8.3 seconds to play... in regulation. Memphis ball after the timeout."
Really thought that Grant corner three was going in ‚Ä¶ get to your tvs if you‚Äôre not already!! 2-point game with 15.3 left!
"Bane's three is off, Blazers rebound, Shaedon finds Jerami in the corner for three... and it's off but ball out off of Memphis (for now). Grizzlies  102, Blazers 100, 15.3 seconds to play, Portland ball after timeout."
"Three-point game, one minute to play..."
Very impressive for Jaren Jackson to play 28 foul-free minutes
"Grizzlies with another challenge, this on the Sharpe and-one."
"Challenge is successful, Bane gets the bucket AND Grant is called for a technical for flopping."
"Grizzlies  77, Blazers 76: end of third quarter. 19 points, 6 rebounds, 2 assists for @JeramiGrant. 14 points, 9 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 block/steal for @DeandreAyton. 13 points, 9 assists, 5 rebounds for Malcolm Brogdon. 13 points, 4 rebounds, 2 assists for @ShaedonSharpe."
Shaedon already at 33 minutes tonight with a quarter to play. Played 42 minutes in Detroit.
Toumani gets the start in the second half...
"Blazers 54, Grizzlies 53: halftime. 12 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steal for @DeandreAyton. 11 points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds for Malcolm Brogdon. 10 points, 2 rebounds for @JeramiGrant. 9 points, 3 rebounds for @ShaedonSharpe."
Smart bonkers to think he's gonna get that
No clear path?
"Blazers sitting on 4 points, all by Jerami Grant, more than midway through the second quarter"
Jerami's tough take to the basket ends a 13-0 Memphis run
Eight-straight to start the second quarter for the Grizz -- 7 of those by Bane -- and the Blazers go down 34-33 with 9:27 to play in the first half.
"Blazers 33, Grizzlies 26: end of first quarter. 9 points, 4 assists, 2 rebounds for Malcolm Brogdon. 6 points, 5 rebounds for @DeandreAyton. 7 points for @skylarmays4. POR shooting 52 percent, MEM 40 percent."
"Chauncey gonna challenge that, Bari deserves that block"
Bari blocked that TWICE
Did Ant get a jesus piece?
A three for Mays and Brogdon shoots a technical for Williams flopping. Four-point play the new fashion way.
"Bane had JG off balance for a second, but JG had him clocked at the rim."

"Ryan Kawalek and @LaCenter_FB wrapped up an undefeated season. Now they'll look to make some noise in 1-A postseason play -- starting tonight vs. Elma.

Shaedon Sharpe (thumb) is a go against Memphis. Chauncey Billups said he is unsure how long Scoot Henderson (ankle) will be out. Billups didn‚Äôt rule out a return Sunday but also didn‚Äôt appear to be too optimistic. But Scoot was on the court getting up shots. So ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/HAuiVGBIf8
