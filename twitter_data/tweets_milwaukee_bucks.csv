"After talking with his players, Bucks coach Adrian Griffin decided to put Brook Lopez back in drop coverage last night.

""They wanted Brook deeper in the drop and I was smart enough to listen to ‚Äòem and it paid off."" 

On the block party, at @TheAtheltic: theathletic.com/5030100/2023/1‚Ä¶"

Technical difficulties tonight are preventing us from taking your calls on @Bucks Talk.  Drop your thoughts here:
"Adrian Griffin: ""Sometimes as coaches we‚Äôre too smart for our own selves. A couple players came to me - I won't disclose (them) - they wanted Brook deeper in a drop. I was smart enough to listen to them and it paid off tonight.‚Äù"
"Adrian Griffin tells reporters that the ATO that got Damian Lillard the 3 was not actually designed that way.

Lillard saw that he was getting top-locked and changed the cut. Giannis Antetokounmpo read it and handed it off to him for a clutch 3."
Jalen Brunson sets an NBA In Season Tournament record with 45 points
Damian Lillard scores 15 of the Bucks final 16 points to seal another dramatic win
"FINAL: Bucks 110, Knicks 105
- Lillard 30pts/4reb/4ast
- Antetokounmpo 22pts/8reb/6ast
- Crowder 14pts/6reb
- Lopez 13pts/5reb/8blk
- Beauchamp 13pts/2reb/2ast
- Middleton 12pts/9reb/4ast"
Another big block by Brook Lopez and the Bucks have a 108-103 lead with 17.8 seconds left.
"Damian Lillard's 2,400th career three-pointer gives the #Bucks a 104-103 lead."
"Antetokounmpo poked the ball away from Randle, but couldn't corral it. Lillard got caught taking a look and that freed up Brunson for a 3.

Knicks now lead, 103-101, with 1:10 left.

Bucks' offensive execution over the last few minutes has left plenty to be desired."
"Bucks are challenging that out of bounds call and I'm not sure they're going to get this one back. 

They lead, 101-98, with 1:59 left though."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo went 3-for-3 from the 3-point line to start the game.

And he just baited Mitchell Robinson into fouling him on a 3-point attempt."
"6 blocked shots tonight for Brook.
He had 2 through the first 4 games."
"With 6:46 left, the Bucks lead, 95-90. 

They've made 19-of-35 from deep tonight, but the Knicks remain in the game behind a great game from Jalen Brunson (38 points on 14-22 fg) and 16 offensive rebounds."
"Khris Middleton getting his first fourth quarter minutes of the season.

(Looks like he is still going to play less than 20 minutes tonight though.)"
"After three quarters, the Bucks lead, 82-76. 

Lillard is leading the Bucks with 15pts/4reb/4ast tonight, but two bench players are in double figures. Crowder up to 14 points, while Beauchamp has 13 points tonight."
"The Damian Lillard + the bench unit is back tonight.

Just spamming pick and rolls and playing off of the gravity Lillard attracts. 3-pointers from Crowder and Beauchamp have the Bucks up, 74-64, with 3:14 left in the third quarter."
"That's at least the third layup the Bucks have booted tonight. 

So strange to see in an NBA game."
"Turnover from Antetokounmpo leads to an easy two for the Knicks and after pushing their lead out to 14 points, the Knicks put together an 8-0 run to get back into the game.

Bucks up, 62-56, with 7:51 left in the third quarter."
"Half: Bucks 56, Knicks 46
- Antetokounmpo 10pts/4reb/4ast
- Middleton 9pts/5reb (8 min)
- Lopez 9pts/4blk
- Lillard 9pts/2reb/4ast"
"Mitchell Robinson is a ridiculous offensive rebounder. Just giving the Bucks hell tonight on the glass. He's up to six O-boards already. 

But the Bucks lead, 53-43, with 1:40 left in the first half."

"Nice trust there by Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Finds MarJon Beauchamp in the right corner for back-to-back 3-pointers. And the Bucks have some energy off the bench here in the second quarter."
"Bobby Portis is down on the floor after that play. 

Looked like Julius Randle's follow through whacked him pretty good on the way down.

Portis got up after about 20 seconds of collecting himself."
"After one quarter, the Knicks lead, 25-21. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo is leading the way for the Bucks with 7 points and two rebounds, while Khris Middleton scored five points in his first five minutes of action."
"Things have evened out a bit, but the Bucks still lead, 16-15, with 4:47 left in the first quarter.

As the Knicks often do, they are beating up the Bucks on the glass. Seven offensive rebounds for them already and that's kept them in the game (8 second-chance points)."
Connaughton and Portis enter for the Bucks with Middleton and Antetokounmpo exiting for tonight's first substitutions.
And there's a defensive three second call on Brook Lopez!
"And the Bucks have come out of the gate motivated tonight.

Six points for Giannis Antetokounmpo, a triple for Khris Middleton and the Bucks lead, 9-2, with 9:34 left in the first quarter. Timeout to the Knicks."
"Jalen Brunson just hit a mid-range jumper on the first possession of the game. Looked like a pretty deep drop from Brook Lopez.

On the other end, the Bucks dial up Giannis Antetokounmpo rolling to the rim on a pass from Damian Lillard for a bucket to match the Knicks."
