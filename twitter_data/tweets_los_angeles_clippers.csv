Of those 5 teams, the Lakers attempt the most 3s (32.4), which is still nearly 10 fewer attempts per game than Memphis (41.5)

Grizzlies aren‚Äôt allowed to take midrange shots, but they‚Äôre dying by 3 right now"

Wow what an overturned review in OKC
Nuggets had 7 turnovers in that first quarter and still got 40 points on the board.
KCP reacted like he tweaked his back on that break layup
"That game in OKC is ridiculous. Thunder buddies offense still misses Shai though, despite the points. 60.2% FGs but 30 points allowed off of turnovers"

Milwaukee looking like they're going to need 20 3s to escape the Knicks tonight
"The Knicks are playing tonight in Milwaukee, then they will return home for two days rest to host the LA Clippers, who will be on four days rest.

Typical Knicks: they're leading through one quarter of play despite shooting 33.3% FGs."
