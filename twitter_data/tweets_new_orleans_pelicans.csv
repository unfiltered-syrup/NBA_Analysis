There's been a few incredible catches in this Ole Miss game

Likely to miss tomorrow‚Äôs game against Toronto and will be re-assessed when Spurs travel to Indiana and New York."

"Go ""Off the Court"" with #Pelicans rookie guard Jordan Hawkins, who enjoys golfing (though maybe not so much yet in New Orleans) and explains why he's had the same uniform number for several years: neworlns.co/47ktcHY pic.twitter.com/IGrng4vjfp"
"Courts burned my corneas, but the games were fun last night. I'm with the people who say the In-Season Tournament winner should get an automatic playoff bid."
We are not far off from Jokic doing the Larry Bird and playing entire games left-handed because he‚Äôs bored.
"I came into this season very skeptical about the NBA on-court product but I‚Äôve really enjoyed watching these first few weeks more than any in recent memory. 

The skill in the league right now is just so incredible. 

(It helps to completely avoid national media as well‚Ä¶)"

Jose Alvarado, Naji Marshall and Trey Murphy remain out."

Pelicans announce they've signed Jeremiah Robinson-Earl to a two-way contract. Waived Kaiser Gates to make room.
Pelicans' local rights getting packaged with other small- and medium-sized teams' local rights and getting sold to a streamer seems like the most likely outcome to me nypost.com/2023/11/02/bus‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/hdDq1l0dxm
"In five games, Herb Jones already has three blocks on 3-point attempts. pic.twitter.com/1B7ozSW94K"

"In a span of 24 hours, the Pels had to overcome:
-- a game w/o Brandon Ingram
-- a 22-point deficit
-- 19 straight missed 3s
-- another game w/o BI & Zion
-- landing home 7 hours before a B2B

The result? Two wins that showcased this group's resilience

"On a fun night in Phoenix where Victor Wembanyama took over and left many in awe.

Devin Booker: ‚ÄúJust trying to figure out what he is because we have never seen him before.‚Äù

"The Pelicans had their best scoring night of the season. Zion and B.I. didn't play. 

Willie Green started CJ, Hawkins, Matt Ryan, Herb and Valanciunas.

‚ÄúWe have been tracking that group together. They have had a ton of success.""

Spurs 111, Suns 106 

Fun finish ahead in PHX."
"The Pelicans landed in New Orleans a little after noon. Their travel schedule wasn't ideal, and they didn't have their All-Star forwards. They beat the Pistons anyway. 

""Total gutsy win for us,"" said Willie Green, whose team is 4-1. nola.com/sports/pelican‚Ä¶"
CJ McCollum has missed 7 games since he was traded to New Orleans. Asked him about being insistent he's in the lineup almost every night. pic.twitter.com/EJL6EO6E02
"It seriously feels like the lob is there every single time. 

It's insane."
"Matt Ryan (career-high 20 pts, 6/8 on 3s) on this night for him: ""It's everything I ever dreamed of. I feel like I'm just getting started, still trying to make a name for myself. I just want to keep this thing going. When you get a taste of it, you want more and more."" pic.twitter.com/sFE40NPdaY"
"CJ McCollum says he played ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" for his shoes with a kid sitting courtside during the first half.

"H/t from @ESPNStatsInfo on this one:

In his first four games, Victor Wembanyama was averaging 5.3 points on 28% shooting in the first half.

Tonight he had 20 points and is shot 8/14 from the field in the first half."
"Tre Jones is heading to the locker room for San Antonio. 

Looked like he took an elbow to the head or ran into an arm on a screen and was down throughout that possession."
