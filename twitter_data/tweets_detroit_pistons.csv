What is K State doing?????
"About to mute ""Ayton"" from my mentions."
"Modern OC refusal to go under center is downright hilarious. K State earned that missed FG with that 4th down nonsense. 

They motioned the back to everyone knew the QB was going to have to run 6 yards to pick up 1, ü§£"
"Asked Monty Williams about if Jaden Ivey knows what he needs to do in order to receive more playing time. Couldn‚Äôt fit the answer in a tweet, but here it is in full: pic.twitter.com/3lmCBxWgCY"
"On Ivey, Monty said he‚Äôs more inclined to lecture players on defense and rebounding than offense.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still a young player. I‚Äôm not giving minutes out, because minutes are precious ‚Ä¶ the standard we should have is excellence and we can‚Äôt have that if guys are gifted minutes.‚Äù"
"Williams on Ivey‚Äôs pathway to more minutes: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still a young player, as I said before, I‚Äôm not giving minutes out. He‚Äôs not the only guy seeing minutes reduced because of mistakes on floor.‚Äù"

"New story: Motor City Cruise players, coaches look to 'earn everything' to get NBA shot detroitnews.com/story/sports/n‚Ä¶"
Milwaukee‚Äôs court looks more official. Almost like it could be used specifically for the playoffs.
"Regular court, baby blue court. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Donovan Mitchell is still a bucket."
"This Pacers court looks nuts on TV, but their uniforms look a little better than I initially thought."
"I still can‚Äôt sign in to @ballysportshelp,ü§£

And they send this obviously AI generated email saying it‚Äôs been fixed. 

Let me go cancel this."
Rhoden says he wants to be dominant on both sides of the ball. Says he wants to be an elite defender.
Jared Rhoden says Isaiah Stewart has been a big vocal leader for him. Says Monte Morris took him and Stanley Umude under his wing.

"Jamelle McMillan says what he wants the Cruise's identity to be similar to the Pistons: ""You have to earn everything."""
"Motor City Cruise GM Ben Carloni on coach Jamelle McMillan: ""Incredible presence in the huddle. He's so well-spoken. I feel like he's a politician, sometimes when I hear him talk."""
"Pistons' defensive rating in games 1-3: 102.7 (seventh)

Games 4-6: 115.8 (22nd)

The verve they had last week has slipped. Could be fatigue (only three teams have played 6 games so far; 11 have played 4). Could be youth. Could be a mix. Curious to see where they'll be in a month"
Going to do a Pistons mailbag for Monday. A week into the season. What do you got for me?

Gotta wonder what the rest of the league is thinking while watching this game.
Wemby getting whistles like that already?

"Williams on playing 5 games in 7 days: ""You can say a lot there to get yourself in financial trouble, but it has been a really tough schedule to start the season. I told the guys that the other day. We've traveled close to 5,000 miles...But I thought our guys showed resiliency."""
"Williams on Marcus Sasser: ""He spaces the right way when he's off the ball. He's not afraid to take big shots. Defensively, he just battles. He's starting to look like a good complement to Cade, and Killian. Those three guys, they played well together tonight."""
"Detroit has to be better at not digging a hole early or not making silly mistakes late. No doubt. Young guys or vets.

But it‚Äôs pretty obvious that a few of their issues ‚Äî all relatively fixable ‚Äî will be cleared up when Bogey, Burks, Livers and Morris return."
"Monty Williams on tonight's loss: ""We held those guys to 53 points in the second half. We let them have 70-plus in the first. I know it's a back-to-back. I know guys are tired, but we showed what we can do and be in the second half, especially in the third quarter."""
"FINAL: Pelicans 125, Pistons 116. Detroit trailed by 25 toward the end of the 2nd. Late rally didn't come early enough. They fall to 2-4. 

Cunningham: 22 points, 11 assists
Sasser: 19 points (6-7 overall, 5-6 from 3)
Thompson: 16 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists"
"Final: #Pelicans 125, #Pistons 116.

The Pistons lose their third straight - all to Western Conference teams. They'll play three of their next four at home. Cade Cunningham led Detroit with 22 points and 11 assists. Marcus Sasser scored all 19 of his points in the second half."
"Pistons will drop their third straight. Too bad of a start. Matt Ryan had 20.

Good fight back but can‚Äôt keep digging yourself that big of a hole.

Marcus Sasser arrived, though."
Duren gets ejected with 8.1 seconds left
Sasser has 19 points. He's 6-7 overall and 5-6 from 3. Making a case for a bigger role.
Sasser is a big shot maker already. Just hit his fifth 3 to cut it to seven with just under a minute left.
Sasser has been great. 7-point game
There's the dagger. Pistons cut it to nine with a Sasser steal and layup. Dyson Daniels responds with a deep 3 to push it back to 12. Not much time left
"Sasser has been good. Pistons are within single digits, 111-103, after the rookie hit his fourth 3 of the night"
"Valanciunas hits a jumper. Harris responds with a 3. Valanciunas answers with a 3. The Pistons are hitting shots, but not preventing any."
This game would probably be close if it wasn't for Matt Ryan making 6-7 from beyond the arc. He has 20.
Pistons get it close and then ‚Ä¶ Matt Ryan. Not the QB. He‚Äôs got 20
Matt Ryan has hit a pair of dagger 3's to stymie Detroit's momentum. He has 21 points in his first career start.
"Cade draws contact, splits the trip. Pistons are now down 10, 96-86, with 10:45 to play"
"End of the 3rd quarter: #Pelicans 94, #Pistons 83.

Thompson: 16 pts, 7 rebs, 5 sats (5 fouls)
Cunningham: 16 pts, 7 asts, 5 TOs
Ivey: 12 pts, 7 rebs, (4 fouls)"
"End of 3: Pelicans 94, Pistons 83. Detroit closed the quarter with a 13-2 run to get back within striking distance. Ivey and Sasser have hit needed shots.

Cunningham: 16 points, 7 assists
Thompson: 16 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists
Ivey: 12 points, 7 rebounds"
"Stewart forced CJ into an airball to end the 3Q. Sasser and Ivey give Detroit hope. An 11-point game going into the fourth. 

Wow."
"Ivey splits a trip at the line, then gets a transition dunk after Hayes forced a steal. Nice stretch for Ivey"
"Ok, Pistons have strung together some good plays. Sasser hit a stepback 3, then Ivey blocked a 3-point attempt by Hawkins and got fouled in transition. Pistons are down 94-80 and have a little momentum after trailing by 23"
Ivey with a really athletic block and he gets fouled in transition for the chance at a couple of free throws.
Pistons staying alive thanks to a pair of Sasser 3s and an Ivey block and free throws. There‚Äôs actually a chance they go into the fourth quarter down 10 or less.
That left corner is Sasser's hotspot.
