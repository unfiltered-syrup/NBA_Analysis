Clutch kick by Kst in a day of struggle
"Thank goodness for college kickers 🤘

#Hookem"
Maalik Murphy DEFINITELY has to work on his decision making and not to be so careless with it.
"Having both Jonathon Brooks and CJ Baxter in that running backs room is a major blessing, my goodness

#Hookem 🤘"
"This Texas defense has definitely sharpened and stiffened up after some really rough outings against Oklahoma and Houston

#Hookem 🤘"
"Texas should absolutely have that football from the fumble recovery

#Hookem"
"Michael Taaffe is a playmakerrrr

#Hookem 🤘"
"Meanwhile, what is going on with Rutgers leading Ohio State with 1 second left before the half?!?"
"Maalik Murphy has loads of potential, my goodness he does, but still clearly needs reps to establish consistency and polish. But my goodness the potential is amazing.

#Hookem"
"Huge TD by Kansas St before the half. As much as Texas has dominated, they have to be careful not to be too careless with it cuz the scoreboard is much closer than what it really should be"
"Xavier Worthy and the @TexasFootball defense these last few weeks 🔥🔥

#Hookem 🤘🤘"
"Now THAT’S what you call a 4th-down conversion. Wow, @TexasFootball 🤘

#Hookem 🔥"
"The potential of this @TexasFootball offense with Maalik Murphy is off the friggin charts 🤘🔥

QUESTIONABLE: Rankins (knee)

The Rockets badly need a new logo. The 'R' design is literally 20 years old now. Beyond dated look.
The Spurs were mismanaged for like 5 years post-Duncan and walked ass-backwards into new Duncan after one year in the tank smh
"The Memphis Grizzlies, at 0-5, are the only remaining team in the NBA without a win.

How did we get to this point? Sat down with ⁦@johnhollinger⁩ to break it all down.

"“I’m more him than John Wooden, I guess""

Ime Udoka played against Bob Knight in 1997, and he says there's a slight resemblance in their coaching styles, though there are some differences audacy.com/sportsradio610…"
"“He can get any shot he wants. He has a certain fluidity and a feel that’s just rare for his size.”

VICTOR WEMBANYAMA IS NOT HUMAN.  theathletic.com/5006677/2023/1…"
THIS ISN’T FAIR @nba
"Mentioned San Antonio needing to get Cedi Osman more minutes with Tre Jones + Wembanyama. 10 points for Osman, 2-for-4 from 3. The hot shooting continues.  theathletic.com/5023091/2023/1…"
Levis is really good

"For Rockets, Aaron Holiday ready with Amen Thompson out houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-n… via @houstonchron"
"Won't happen tonight, maybe not ever, but after @dmorey traded Harden and Tucker, Sixers can still go with all ex-Rocket lineup of Beverley, Melton, House, Covington, Morris; Martin as 6th man, Nurse (former RGV coach) as coach. Feel like I'm stepping back in time watching them."
"Working at Toyota Center as Boban Marjanovic is preparing to leave, but stops and stands in a doorway, waiting and waiting and waiting. Apparently, he saw somebody with a handcart and waited there as long as necessary to hold the door open. That's him every day."
Rest In Peace Coach Knight. We appreciate you 🙏🏿🙌🏿
"Ime Udoka did not have an update on Amen Thompson, but added that a grade II ankle sprain is “usually in the weeks range”."
