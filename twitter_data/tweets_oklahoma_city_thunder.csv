Is it wrong to admit I still don't know what the hell happened on that final play
What I‚Äôve learned tonight is the NBA basket interference rules are as clear pick up hoops rules when the ball hits the top of the backboard.
Lu Dort said the first ever in-season tournament game felt a little different than just a normal regular season game.
Chet Holmgren on Steph Curry ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cool first full circle moment. Going to his game however many years ago it was‚Äù mentioned it‚Äôs cool now being on the NBA floor competing against him. He added the Warriors are up 1-0 in that battle.
Josh Giddey acknowledged he has to get more aggressive earlier in games he can not keep waiting for the fourth quarter to get aggressive ‚ÄúI have to be better in that aspect‚Äù
"Chet Holmgren jumped in unprompted after Josh Giddey gave an answer:

‚ÄúHe had a huge 4th quarter. I don‚Äôt want that to go under the bus‚Ä¶

I want that to get attention. This is a tough dude. I don‚Äôt know what neighborhood from Australia he‚Äôs from but‚Ä¶‚Äù"
"Chet Holmgren ‚Äú[Josh Giddey] had a huge fourth quarter. I don‚Äôt want that to go under the bus.‚Äù Said without Josh‚Äôs 4th it wouldn‚Äôt have even been a close game, even made a joke ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what neighborhood [Josh Giddey] is from in Australia‚Ä¶but he is tough‚Äù"
"Chet Holmgren on Josh Giddey: ""I don't know what neighborhood he's from in Australia, but he's a tough dude."""
"Josh Giddey on the final bucket: ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I don‚Äôt think it should‚Äôve came down to that for us.‚Äù"
Chet Holmgren said he is fine after taking an Elbow to the face from Draymond Green a ‚Äúhigh level competitor‚Äù said they both love to compete.
"Mark Daigneault said that on the controversial game winning bucket, he was told no the refs that Draymond Green touched the rim but not enough to impact the play. pic.twitter.com/L23ARDm73d"

Mark Daigneault on Lu Dort: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a gamer man. He just has a knack for rising to the level of the game. He‚Äôs always there.‚Äù
"Controversial ending aside‚Ä¶

Truly impressive game from this OKC team.

No SGA.

JDub fouls out.

Came down to one contentious bucket at the buzzer.

Dort/Chet/Giddey/JDub/Cason/Joe were excellent tonight.

Showed the potential of this core maybe more than any game this season."
