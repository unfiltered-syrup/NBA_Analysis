Nets: Why Ben Simmons is out vs. Celtics after hot start clutchpoints.com/nets-news-broo‚Ä¶
"Final: Sixers 112, Suns 100

Joel Embiid finishes with 26 and 11 in 3 quarters as Philly opens the game up in the fourth and pulls away for a fourth straight win, and is now 4-1 on the year.

Kevin Durant had 31 for Phoenix, while the rest of the Suns shot a combined 33 percent."
Sixers don‚Äôt realllly have a ‚Äúbench to clear‚Äù do they? Even when they do there‚Äôs 3 rotation guys out there. Deep team
Covington still diving to cause turnovers deep into trash time
"Maxey double double, 22 points 10 dimes,  Hanlen said they were really pushing the play making this offseason"
"Maxey double double, Hanlen said they were really pushing the play making this offseason"
Maxey double double
BBall Paul chants at the center
"Not only did the Sixers stretch the lead with Kevin Durant on the court and Joel Embiid on the bench, but Nick Nurse never had to come back to Embiid at all. Been a very impressive fourth quarter from Philly, which is going to win going away."
67% sure Maxey walks with a little more swagger this year
Covington took his ‚ÄúHorford in OKC‚Äù rest year now he‚Äôs back!
Harris saw KD as a mouse in the house and bullied into a pull up
Pop the mutha fucking Kork
"After 3: Sixers 80, Suns 75

After Phoenix had gone on a 12-3 run to cut an 11-point deficit to 2 late in the third, Joel Embiid throws in a shotclock-beating heave to give Philly a bit of breathing room.

Kevin Durant is on, and Embiid off, to start the fourth."
Joel‚Äôs bail out fadeaway 3 leaves Sixers up 5 with 12 to go. Big opportunity here if they can string together another good defensive quarter this game
"Super Slow, annoying painful, extended Suns run lol"
Dame on a Supermax or Oubre on a min
I tried to tell you Oubre > Beal but did you wanna listen ? NooOooO well well well now you come crawling back
"Sixers had a great chance to put the lead up to 12-15 but brick city, let suns back in"
Kork coming for Meltons role?‚Äô
Hopefully someone texts OG about how badly the Sixers could use him for guys like KD Jimmy Tatum
Nurse seems to like crashing O-boards more than Doc did
"Jusuf Nurkic, after getting evaluated for a concussion after taking an accidental shot to the head from Joel Embiid in the first half, is now back in the game for Phoenix."
"Sixers make up for the ugly possession with a crisper one. Joel draws double kicks to Maxey to find Melton open, no good, long offensive board (!) to Joel for pull up"
"Embiid stranded Maxey open on the wing, then Kelly stranded Tobias in the corner. Harris clearly wanted the swing swing let oubre know"
Embiid faked a s-k it cellie ü§£the crowd got it
Nice look by Joel on the CUT! An offense that back door cuts is good who knew!
"Drew Eubanks is in the game to start the second half for Jusuf Nurkic, who isn't on Phoenix's bench."
"Expect to see plenty of Trendon Watford tonight with Simmons out after he logged a DNP-CD in Chicago.

Watford can fill a similar role to Simmons as a transition ball-handler and halfcourt screener/short-roll playmaker.

He was very impressive against Miami. Just 22-years-old."
"Halftime: 76ers 52, Suns 45

Kelly Oubre's sensational start to the season continues, with b2b 3s to end the half giving him 17 on 7-for-10 shooting in the first half.

Kevin Durant has 14 for the short-handed Suns, who are 5-20 from 3 and have only 12 points off 13 Philly TOs."
I love Embiid blocks but I have so much ptsd from all of the times he goes flying and struggles to stick a landing amid tangle of legs
KD nice dime shooo
Loving the Tobias year 13 leap
Joel should have just given it to a guard cmon
"A ref trifecta‚Ä¶ misses easy call, then T‚Äôs up the angry player who got fouled."
If the Sixers can make every team miss all their 3‚Äôs it‚Äôs Joever
"This game has been played like one you'd expect that started at 1pm. Both teams are struggling to score and Philly, in particular, has been throwing it around ‚Äì already up to 9 turnovers through just 18 minutes."
"After barely playing in Thursday's win over Toronto immediately after the trade, some first quarter minutes for Robert Covington ‚Äì and repeat early minutes for Furkan Korkmaz ‚Äì this afternoon against Phoenix."
"As expected, Nic Claxton is out tonight with a left ankle sprain. #nets"
"Nets say Ben Simmons (back- injury maintenance) is OUT tonight vs. Boston.

Nic Claxton and Cam Johnson also remain out."

"Frank Vogel says Devin Booker isn‚Äôt playing today with his ankle issue. He said Booker had some soreness after Thursday‚Äôs game, and with the very quick turnaround ‚Äî it‚Äôs about 36 hours since Thursday‚Äôs loss ended ‚Äî they‚Äôre being cautious. He could play tomorrow in Detroit."
"Nick Nurse on the Suns: ‚ÄúI think the narrative that they‚Äôre not deep, and they don‚Äôt have other players (outside their stars) is completely false.‚Äù Said despite their slow start, he‚Äôs been impressed by what he‚Äôs seen on film from Phoenix."
"New ESPN story: Myles Turner put himself in the history books last night, as the NBA‚Äôs inaugural in-season tournament kicked off with an entertaining slate of seven games featuring several dramatic finishes and impressive performances.

"Jalen Brunson gets the ultimate comp: ""I had to guard Kobe all the time. Kobe had all the shot fakes, all the footwork. So he just kept you guessing. It‚Äôs hard to guard when you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming. And Jalen‚Äôs proven that.‚Äù
