"No Claxton, No Cam Johnson, No Ben Simmons for Brooklyn tonight vs. Boston"
"Al Horford would be the easy answer, but wouldn‚Äôt be stunned if Oshae Brissett gets a spot start tonight to keep Horford in his role & stagger the lineups. Looked like Oshae got some work in with the starters at shootaround. #Nets are also smaller without Claxton. We‚Äôll see‚Ä¶"

"Nightmare start continues for Marcus Smart and the Grizzlies.

Up 10 with 3:00 left and up 7 with 1:32 left, Memphis loses in overtime at Portland (24-7-10 for Malcolm Brogdon).

The Grizzlies (5th best record in the NBA last year) are 0-6."

1. BOSTON 4-0
2. Denver 5-1
     Golden State 5-1
4. Dallas 4-1
     New Orleans 4-1
6. Philadelphia 3-1

I love watching basketball more than almost anything on this earth and I wanna cry after one minute of viewing a game on this Bulls court. There has to be an idea better than this @NBA.

Neemias Queta (right foot injury management) - OUT"
"Neemias Queta is out for #Celtics #Nets but traveled with the team, perhaps some hope he could at least get on the floor and progress toward a return sometime during this road trip. Sounds like he tweaked his foot early in the schedule & they‚Äôre being cautious after pain lingered"

Overall, @spurs are proving an old NBA adage w/their early success: If you play hard and unselfishly, good shit happens."
