"Luka Doncic tried to go at Michael Porter Jr. over and over again.

No dice.

Doncic shot 2-8 and committed 5 turnovers when MPJ was his primary defender.

""if you‚Äôre not going to contribute (on defense), you shouldn‚Äôt be out there,"" Porter said.

"NEW @AlleyOopPod VIDEO!

As great as the Nuggets are playing, it's the Celtics who should be the early NBA title favorites.

@StoolGreenie and I discussed why, Jayson Tatum's MVP candidacy, Kristaps/Jrue, and more.

"No Pickaxe and Roll tonight, but I‚Äôm planning to go live tomorrow morning at 11am!"
"Asked Nikola Jokic how his back is feeling. He said ""Good. Thank you."" 
Then he asked about my back. I told him his is more important than mine. He said ""We don't know that my friend."" 
So, I got that going for me."
"Nikola Jokiƒá continues to dominate this season in ways unique only to him.

""I hope you all appreciate Nikola's consistent greatness, because not many guys can do what he does every single night.""

"Michael Porter Jr. again says he suffered a Grade 3 ankle sprain in the lead-up to the season. He says his ankle was around 50% on opening night. Now, it's at 75%. He says it's sore after games but continues to get better."
Michael Porter Jr. says his ankle still isn't 100%. Says he was closer to 50% to start the regular season. Feels like he's about 70% now.
"Malone on Jamal Murray: ""He‚Äôs been battling with his shins, still coming off the knee recovery from a year ago, and he plays 39 minutes tonight. He plays the entirety of the fourth quarter. Not ideal, but I felt it was important to get this win, and he was a part of that."""

"Malone on Michael Porter Jr.: ""He was really locked into the gameplan, switching onto guys like Luka and Kyrie and just doing the best job he can defensively. ... Michael had his fingerprints all over the win tonight."""

Michael Malone says Jamal Murray is the one guy he's worried about heading into tomorrow's game against Chicago. Malone says Murray's shins have bothered him.
"Michael Malone: ""I hope we all appreciate Nikola's consistent greatness."""
"Michael Porter Jr gets the DPOG chain tonight. Coach Malone specifically talked about MPJ‚Äôs deflections, contests, and the effort he put forth on switches particularly with Doncic and Irving. 2 blocked shots as well."
"Michael Malone on Michael Porter Jr.'s defense: ""Tonight was a hell of a performance by him on both ends."""

Tonight's defensive player of the game: Michael Porter Jr.
"Michael Porter Jr. got the Defensive Player of the Game chain tonight, Michael Malone says."
"This is what the Nikola Jokic‚Äôs pass went in as btw live. 

Never counted as an assist and he was ONE away from recording a triple double and passing Jason Kidd  for 4th All-Time

"Final Rotations for the Nuggets as they defeat the Mavericks 125-114.

-Nikola Jokiƒá: 33-14-9 (missing an assist?ü§î)
-Michael Porter: 24 points, 9 rebounds, strong defensive night on Luka
-Jamal Murray: 18 points, 13 assists, just a regular John Stockton now

"If the NBA season ended today, would Michael Porter Jr. make the In-Season All-Tournament Team and also be the defensive player of the tournament as well? pic.twitter.com/93xCqDhSSX"
"Jokic is life, I swear."
The Denver Nuggets are now undefeated this season in games that are not preceded by a really sick Halloween party.
"Grant Williams has to vacate the Batman nickname.

Nikola Jokiƒá tonight:

33 points
14 rebounds
9 assists
14/16 FG
2/2 3P"
It's cool as hell that Jokic invented and then perfected his own type of jump shot. Not many players in NBA history have their own signature shot.
Sombor Shuffle üï∫
Think KCP got away with a foul on that offensive rebound that MPJ put back for a layup.
Jamal Murray gets hit with a tech arguing a foul call. Not really sure what he can do defensively in that situation.
Not sure what's wrong with AG's hands tonight but he's having it rough out there with his handle. Needs to just finish from here out.
