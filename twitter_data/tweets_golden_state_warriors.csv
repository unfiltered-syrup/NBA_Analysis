"Steve Kerr: “For us to take that next step, Wiggs, JK and Gary have to be the athletes that they are. They have to provide that force and speed. Offensive rebounds, driving to the hoop, getting fouled, easy baskets…It rounds out our team.” theathletic.com/5029701/2023/1…"
I feel like some things are common sense. Like including utensils and napkins in a takeout order. Everything has gotten so expensive and establishments have gotten so chimmy.

"Chris Paul has 54 assists and 6 turnovers this season, but can’t find his jumper right now: “They ain’t going in. But good thing about it is that’s not the normal. It’s crazy to think I can score 1 point, 2 points and we can still win.” pic.twitter.com/F61lZqioJX"
"Draymond Green: “Chet’s a problem.” 

Looked at Holmgren’s box score line on his way out: “7-for-9 for 24 points. That’s insane.” pic.twitter.com/ADWk8UdGYD"
Here is Draymond Green’s perspective on that wild late-game goaltend overturn and Curry game-winner pic.twitter.com/coxzsAwLlM
"Steve Kerr: “We have a decade of experience closing games, winning close games, winning championships. Last year was an exception. This year is the rule.”"
"Steve Kerr is actively trying to end any conversation about last season: “We need to leave last year in the rear view mirror.”

"Apparently no basket interference or goaltend on the winning layup. Officials must have rightly determined the ball was going in and the scramble at the rim didn’t change that. Draymond did touch the rim, but OKC’s Josh Giddey touched the net."
Both the Warriors and Thunder scored more than 30 points in every quarter. Shootout at in the OKC Corral.
Play by play lists Draymond with the winning basket. That can’t be right.
"Warriors survive, snag 141-139 win at OKC. Second consecutive nail-biter decided inside the final second. Passed the kind of test they'll see a lot from younger, quicker teams. Now 5-1, 4-0 on the road."
"What an ending here in OKC... Draymond Green called for basket interference on a game-winning layup from Steph Curry. But after a lengthy review, the call wasn't just overturned, the bucket was credited to Green.

Warriors beat the Thunder 141-139."
Wild finish in Oklahoma City. Steph Curry game-winning floater initially waved off because of Draymond Green basket interference. Lengthy review. Call overturned. Currently being credited to Draymond for a tapback. Warriors win 141-139. They're 4-0 on the road.
Crazy game. Curry deserved that game-winner.
"Klay Thompson game-winner with 0.2 seconds Wedesday night 

Steph Curry game-winner with 0.2 seconds Friday night"

He went up for a shot ...
The Heat are 2-4 but also 1-0 in the in-season tournament sooooooo
Andrew Wiggins showing some life on the offensive glass in this fourth quarter. Been missing early this season. Just created a Kuminga layup with that last tap. Steve Kerr pumped about it. He's going with Kuminga/Wiggins/Draymond frontline. Very little Looney (11 mins) vs OKC.
"The most points the Warriors had allowed this season was 114

The Thunder have 123 points with 8 minutes left"
"It's 123-119 in this Warriors-Thunder game with 8:10 left. Could be talking 140 territory for both teams. Already 32 combined made 3s. OKC shooting 61 percent, up four."
"Dario Saric's season high was 21 points last season 

He's up to 20 right now in his sixth game with the Warriors"
