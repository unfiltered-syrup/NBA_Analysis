USF has yet to throw an incompletion today. Memphis secondary getting gashed through the air again today and it's keeping this game close. 28-21 Tigers with 5:10 left in the first half.
"Seth Henigan picking up where he left off. Through 3 drives today: He's 7-8 for 138 yards and 2 TDs passing, with 12 yards and 1 TD rushing. 21-7 Memphis over USF in 1Q."
"Beautiful homecoming afternoon at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium, and a beautiful start for Memphis football. 14-0 Tigers over USF and the game isn't 4 mins old."
"Ben Simmons (back/injury maintenance) is listed as OUT tonight for the @BrooklynNets vs Celtics game. 

Nic Claxton (left ankle sprain) and 
Cam Johnson (left calf strain) remain OUT as well."

"The worst part of the 6th loss is the Memphis Grizzlies played so damn hard.

‚ÄúThis is painful,‚Äù @PetePranica says. 

Doesn‚Äôt have the same ring as Hammer, Nail, Coffin."
they were up 10 with 3 mins left and still couldn‚Äôt win.   just totally ridiculous.   psa- pic.twitter.com/68mF2U1A0y
"Pete Pranica about summed it up on the broadcast. 

""This... is painful."""
Portland up four with 39 seconds remaining.
Who has the Boogie Ellis pain tweet?
Bane might really play 45 minutes tonight.
Overtime.
"Led by 10 with 3:21 to play. Tie game. 

8 seconds to get a shot. Everyone should know who is getting it."
"15 seconds between the Grizzlies and Trail Blazers. 

No team needs a win more than Memphis."
The best two plays of this Grizzlies season might be the two Taylor Jenkins coach‚Äôs challenges tonight.
"Taylor Jenkins goes 2-2 on challenges tonight. 

And they were big ones."
Just let Pete and Brevin officiate the game.
A fifth foul on Bane. Grizzlies challenging.
How do you fix the non-Bane minutes? You get completely awesome Jaren Jackson Jr.
The double full timeouts and free throws at the end of the third quarter actually helped the Grizzlies extend Bane's rest without the game being played.
Bismack Biyombo sighting.
Another foul for the Grizzlies at the end of the quarter. Have to execute better.
"Bane already over 30 minutes. At some point he's going to have to get a rest. 

That's going to feel do-or-die for Memphis."
"Bad news: The Grizzlies still struggling to shoot from the 3-point line.

Good news: So are the Blazers."
Fourth foul on Bane. That looms large.
The Grizzlies trail Portland 54-53 at halftime. Led by as many as 11.
"Bane back in, drops a dime to Tillman to stop the bleeding."
"Bane at the 2 guard, even when he's the point guard. 

Kennard starts with the ball. Love it. That's his spot."
"What more could you want from Desmond Bane tonight? 

Took the ball and said ""I got this."""
Vince Williams has a lot of good pieces to his game. Just needs to slow it down a touch. Potential is there.
"Given the Grizzlies offensive struggles, it‚Äôs wild Kennard only played five minutes that first run and got up one forced, late-clock shot."
Grizzlies get their lineup with Bane and Jackson back on the court and immediately make a run to take the lead back.
"It‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt shoot as many 3s‚Äù for this team. 

Lack of rebounding means more players crashing the glass and fewer transition chances. 

Lack of creators offensively means more of the easy shots, aka 3s. 

They‚Äôre just in a really tough spot."
"Grizzlies foul with 2 seconds left in the quarter. Idk. 

Down 7 after 1."
Ziaire Williams wasn‚Äôt flopping he was just being thin as a fishing pole.
"I‚Äôm pro in-season tournament but anti ‚Äúhard sell‚Äù in pretty much all facets of life, so now I‚Äôm conflicted"
I think the in-season courts are more distracting than cool. Maybe I‚Äôm lame.
"Grizzlies fans, follow @TheJonahDylan for our CA coverage of tonight‚Äôs game. 
I‚Äôll see ya Sunday."
Official now.  Spencer Dinwiddie (left ankle sprain) and Dennis Smith Jr. (left hip contusion) are both AVAILABLE tonight for the @BrooklynNets.
"We have three officials (and they will show up on time). They have been assigned by the #NBA: James Capers, Brett Nansel and Andy Nagy. @memgrizz tip off #InSeasonTournament play against POR. See it on @GrizzOnBally starting at 8:30 with Grizzlies Live.
#BackToTheGrind"
Nets just wrapped up shootaround. Spencer Dinwiddie told me that he will play tonight vs Chicago.
"If a team were in the top six in pace of play, steals, blocks, opponent turnovers and defensive rebounding you might think that team was funneling all of that into transition play. The Grizzlies are that team, and are 24th in fastbreak points."
"Me and @KevinOConnorNBA recorded this on Winners and Losers of first week of season.  You should prob pass on this one, it‚Äôs super lame.   open.spotify.com/episode/2cKmlf‚Ä¶"
"Here we go. The inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament starts today.

 To some players, $500,000 is a meh incentive, but to the ones making not much more than that, it‚Äôs a big deal. 

‚ÄúThem four games, I‚Äôm going to be cheering as loud as I ever have.‚Äù
