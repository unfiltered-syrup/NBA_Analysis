"It's early yet, but two of the emerging patterns with the Wizards are:
+ Deni Avdija's 3-point shooting is improved and
+ the team's defense remains a major weakness.

Here's my piece from Miami for @TheAthletic ⬇️:

"Five games into the 2023-24 season, Deni Avdija is showing signs of significant offensive growth, but the Wizards' defense continues to struggle. My dispatch for @TheAthletic ⬇️:

"Deni Avdija was widely compared to Danilo Gallinari coming into the 2020 draft. That take didn’t age well.

Or did it? I investigated and peeled back some unexpectedly fun layers in the art of NBA draft comparisons. @MonSportsNet monumentalsportsnetwork.com/article/was-de…"
It remains baffling to me that Jokic became the “analytics darling” when he’s basically invented his own on-court style and personifies the “make his teammates better” lore that draws so many to the sport.
"They got away with it tonight because of hot shooting, but man, the Bucks gotta up their ball containment a ton between now and the spring. Damian Lillard's gotta learn how to guard, because Jalen Brunson's not gonna be the only guy targeting him on switches."
"Final: Heat 121, Wizards 114
Kuzma: 22 pts., 4 rebs., 3 assts.
Poole: 19 pts., 1 reb., 6 assts.
Herro: 24 pts., 11 rebs., 4 assts."
"With the Wizards' end-of-bench subs in the middle of a 12-0 run, one of the most engaged players on the Wizards' bench is Deni Avdija, who sprung off his seat to lobby Wes Unseld Jr. to challenge an out of bounds call against the Wizards."
"The lineup of Ryan Rollins, Johnny Davis, Bilal Coulibaly, Eugene Omoruyi and Anthony Gill is on a 10-0 run to cut Washington's deficit to 115-100 with 5:00 to play."
"Down 115-90, it looks like Wes Unseld Jr. is about to bring Eugene Omoruyi and Anthony Gill into the game, joining Ryan Rollins, Johnny Davis and Bilal Coulibaly."
That was a 41-point third quarter for the Heat. The Wizards now trail 101-81 at the start of the fourth quarter.
"Every game, Bilal Coulibaly shows some new kind of potential. Decisive in what he wants to do, even tries splashy plays… tbh he’s been the wiz player I’m most interested in watching"
"The Heat have outscored the Wizards 29-13 in the third quarter and now lead 89-67. Tyler Herro is close to his second career regular-season triple-double; he has 17 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists."
"Pacers-Cavs is just a good game, period. We get plenty of these in the much-maligned normal regular season, but if the tournament gets more people to notice them, probably a net positive."
"At halftime, the Heat lead the Wizards 60-54. Tyler Herro has a game-high 12 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists already. Kyle Kuzma has a team-high 11 points. Deni Avdija and Jordan Poole have 10 points apiece."
"I (somewhat) understand the concerns about Evan Mobley's offensive development, but his defensive versatility is unreal and we should not lose sight of that."
"One adjustment the Heat made at the start of the second quarter: some full-court pressure, which has slowed the tempo of the Wizards' offense. On two occasions, the Wizards almost didn't get the ball across the timeline within eight seconds."
"That was a superb shot-making first quarter by the Wizards, who did the vast majority of their damage in the halfcourt. Washington made 13 of its 17 field-goal attempts, including 7 of 9 from three-point range. At the end of the first quarter, the score's tied 34-34."
The Wizards made 10 of their first 11 field-goal attempts and began the game 5 for 5 from three-point range. They trail the Heat 28-26 with 3:20 remaining in the first quarter.
"Might be the longest 3 of Deni Avdija’s career?

About the ketchup-red court: I think it's less of a distraction here for spectators in the arena than it is for people who are watching on TV. I say that from some of the clips the teams already have posted.
"The Wizards have started this game well on offense, making seven of their eight field-goal attempts and all four of their three-point attempts. The Wizards lead 19-16 with 6:18 remaining in the first quarter."
"The Wizards' keys to their game tonight against the Heat:
+ Control their defensive board. Put a body on someone. Don't spectate. 
+ Against any Heat zone defense, attempt to collapse the zone to create open 3s.
+ Play with physicality."
"The Washington Wizards' starters tonight against the Miami Heat:
PG: Tyus Jones
SG: Jordan Poole
SF: Deni Avdija 
PF: Kyle Kuzma
C: Daniel Gafford"

"The Wizards have received some welcome injury news on Corey Kispert's sprained left ankle. Although he will miss tonight's game, Kispert has avoided a severe sprain. He's walking normally and without a walking boot. The goal now is to reduce the swelling and let the ankle heal."
"Daniel Gafford, who has missed Washington's last two games because of an ankle sprain, will be available to play tonight in Miami, per the Wizards' injury report. Corey Kispert (sprained left ankle) is OUT for tonight's game."

The Wizards play their first game of the in-season tournament tonight. Generally positive thoughts about it in the locker room (once everyone learned how it actually works): washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11…
"The NBA In-Season Tournament, which starts tomorrow, is supposed to be a big positive for rebuilding teams. But for the rebuilding and struggling Washington Wizards, the enthusiasm is a bit more muted. Read story ⬇️:

"We’re all systems, operating within and adjacent to other systems, which operate within and adjacent to other systems, and so on."
Daniel Gafford and Corey Kispert are both questionable for Wizards-Heat with their left ankle sprains.
"The Wizards have listed Corey Kispert (sprained left ankle) as questionable to play Friday in Miami. Daniel Gafford, who has missed the last two games because of a sprained left ankle, is not listed on the injury report, which should indicate he'll be available to play."
"Corey Kispert, who sprained his left ankle last night, is walking without crutches. Although Wes Unseld Jr. said Kispert is moving better, Kispert did not practice today in Atlanta. Daniel Gafford, who has missed two games with an ankle sprain, was a partial practice participant."

"LeBron was amazing of course, but the most encouraging sign for the Lakers was Austin Reaves re-emerging at the end of overtime (and the third quarter on, to a lesser extent). They better hope that gets him out of his early-season funk."
"Really good win for the Mavs tonight. That's why Dallas people are so excited, right?"
