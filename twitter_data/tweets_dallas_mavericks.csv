No 2nd guess here. I think Chris Kleiman is awesome. But I'm always a believer in coaches doing no harm. There would have been no harm in kicking and continuing. There is harm in what happened here esp with Texas keeping in Howard under constant pressure
All those people in burnt orange should kneel in thanks.
College kickers....
"Would be a very tough spot for Manning, but it needs to happen, right?"
Sark might rue not attempting at least one of those field goals. Sounds like fans already ruing it.
"Updated:  Here's what the Mavericks had to say about the first in-season tournament game, the slow start and  rebounding woes that contributed to Denver's 125-114 win Friday night.

"Doncic on his recently rising turnover totals, including 9 tonight. pic.twitter.com/VM8H1oSgkZ"
"Slow starts have been an issue for the Mavs the last few years and they're seeing that happen again. Allowed 43 in 1st qtr at SA, 36 at MEM, and 40 tonight at DEN (14-20 FG) Maybe it's a road thing since in their two at home allowed 25 & 23 to BKN & CHI"
"Mavs won streak ends at 4 in DEN. A 40 pt 1st qtr buries them as they were down 16 at the qtr and never got closer than 7 in 1st half and 8 in 2nd. Luka 34-10-8 Inc 6-11 3pt but tied a career hi with 9 TO. Kyrie was the bright spot esp in 2nd half 22 pts 7 assts, 4 stls 2 blks"
"Mavericks no longer among the unbeaten as Nuggets strike early and hold on for a 125-114 victory.

Why does it feel like Dallas is about to make a run? Maybe it's indigestion.
"Looks like Lively came down on Gordon's foot, came up limping. He's testing his ankle during the timeout, but it doesn't look like he's staying in the game."
"Mavs allow 40 in 1st and trail in DEN 70-55. Jokic 20-8-5. Mavs their own worst enemy not taking care of the ball with 10 TO/16 pts. Luka with 6 TO, mostly unforced. Luka 12-4-5, Kyrie 10. 2nd half soon @971TheFreak"
"Jokic scored 13 of his 20 points in the second quarter. Mavs at one point got the deficit down to 56-49, but they trail 70-55 at halftime."
"The Mavericks didn't play a bad second quarter, but they only shaved one point off of Denver's lead, thanks to a Jokic triple at the buzzer that made it 70-55. Jokic has 20 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Luka has 12 points, four rebounds, five assists."
5 turnovers for Doncic. Yikes.
"Irving checks back in with two points. Irving or Doncic or ideally for Dallas both need to get going. Irving has two points, Doncic 10.

Somehow, though, Dallas is down by 12 and it feels like it should be worse."
Braun in there outhustling 3 Mavs to the ball.
"Tough start for young Lively. Two points, two rebounds, two fouls."
By far the worst quarter of the young season for the Mavericks as they trail 40-24 going into the second. Outrebounded 11-4 and allowing the Nuggets to make 70 percent of their shots is a lethal combination.
"Biggest deficits Mavs have faced this season:

San Antonio -- 7
Brooklyn -- 7
Memphis -- 8
Chicago -- 6
Currently -- 14"
"This has gone sideways pretty quick for Dallas, from a 4-0 lead to a 19-14 deficit. Mavs have 3 early turnovers, 2 by Doncic."
Crazy sight. pic.twitter.com/VcCinpkfeA
"Mavs starters: Jones, Williams, Lively, Doncic, Irving.
Nuggets: Porter, Gordon, Jokic, Caldwell-Pope, Murray."

Tip has been moved back, look for a 9:23 tip @971TheFreak"
"In-Season Tournament court at Ball Arena in Denver. 3 point line dimensions were off and parts of the court had to be re-painted today according to Denver head coach Michael Malone.

"Sweeney says it wasn’t until after shootaround that Mavs learned the court had the wrong 3-point dimensions. He says the lines were painted too far from basket.

“Hopefully it’s the accurate, correct one now. And if it isn’t, hopefully we make more and then it doesn’t matter.”"

Always appreciate Michael Malone’s thoughtful answers. Here he discusses what makes Dereck Lively II’s role and abilities so valuable to the Mavericks. pic.twitter.com/Wys74f5Y17
Denver coach Michael Malone said the crew at Ball Arena had to repaint parts of the court earlier today because 3-point line dimensions weren’t right. Said he hopes it’s dry so there aren’t “blue footprints everywhere.”
Malone says part of the Nuggets’ in-tournament court had to be repainted because it had the wrong 3-point dimensions.

"Tonight on our broadcast we'll hear thoughts on the In-Season Tournament from Dante Exum who won the 2022 Copa del Rey w/ FC Barcelona and asst coach Marko Milic who won multiple Slovenian Cups with Olimpia and played in the Copa del Rey and Coppa Italia. Mavs at Denver, 9p BSSW."
"Not trying to hate on the NBA for trying something new, but maybe come up with a better name for your in season tournament than the ""in season tournament"""
"OK, to catch everybody up, Kyrie Irving (foot) is available tonight at Denver and Maxi Kleber (right small toe dislocation) is out."
"This is what it will look like tonight for the Mavs’ first in-season tournament game, which starts at 9 Dallas time on ESPN. Gives new meaning to the “painted area.” pic.twitter.com/nEepXJfIi0"
"For Mavs vs Nuggets (9p, BSSW), the Mavs are now listing Kyrie Irving (left foot sprain, out last two games) as available. Maxi Kleber is out, dislocated right small toe. First game of West Group B in the NBA's In-Season Tournament. Mavs are 1 of just 2 undefeated teams remaining"
"Kyrie Irving is listed as ""available"" tonight. Maxi Kleber is out with a right small toe dislocation."
