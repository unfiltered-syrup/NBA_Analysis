"Got a workout in before tonight's game. Gave this guy who seemed to be a teenager/in his early 20s some advice on his form for RDLs.  

He finished the conversation by saying ""Thank you, sir!""

...I'm not sure how to feel about this lol"

"Taurean Prince (left patellar tendonitis) has been downgraded to out for tonight’s road game against the Magic, per the Lakers."
"Markelle Fultz will be a game-time decision tonight for the @OrlandoMagic’s home game against the L.A. Lakers. 

Gary Harris and Wendell Carter Jr. are out."
"Say what you will about the Bucks' court, but the coaching staff's matching quarter-zips are nice."
"I'm sorry, J.J. Redick turns 40 next year?"
"Grizzlies-Trail Blazers will kick off the in-season tournament group play for Group West A later tonight. 

Lakers will kick off their in-season tournament schedule in a week against the Suns. pic.twitter.com/KPf004bmDO"
"Taurean Prince is listed as questionable for the Lakers' road game against the Orlando Magic tomorrow. 

Rui Hachimura remains sidelined. Gabe Vincent, Jarred Vanderbilt and Jalen Hood-Schifino aren't available. pic.twitter.com/asS6znQJ9F"
"News: #Magic are listing Wendell Carter Jr. (Left Hand; Fractured third metacarpal) as OUT, Gary Harris (Right Groin; Strain) as Doubtful and Markelle Fultz (Left Knee; Swelling) as questionable on the team's injury for Saturday's game vs. L.A.

Kevon Harris (2-way) is also out. pic.twitter.com/cdmItafNQK"
My @orlandosports story about the update the #Magic provided on Wendell Carter Jr. (left hand) and an explanation of the injury: orlandosentinel.com/2023/11/03/orl…
"Just landed in Orlando with an update: Lakers guard Gabe Vincent will be out for two weeks with left knee effusion, the Lakers say. 

He will be re-evaluated by team physicians."
That boy P5 is good😵‍💫
"More injury updates from the #Magic: Gary Harris suffered a strained right groin tonight at Utah.

Markelle Fultz missed tonight’s game at Utah due to swelling of his left knee.

Both will be re-evaluated after the team’s return to Orlando."
NEWS: #Magic say Wendell Carter Jr. has suffered a fractured third metacarpal of his left hand tonight at Utah. The course of treatment will be determined after the team’s return to Orlando.
Could be a win the battle/lose the war sitch if Carter’s hand is that jacked up 😐
"The @OrlandoMagic close out their West Coast trip with a 115-113 win over the Jazz.

Paolo Banchero caps off a 30-point night with a go-ahead bucket with 14.1 seconds left."
"Paolo Banchero drives to the rim, finishes with the left and gives the @OrlandoMagic a 114-113 lead with 14.1 seconds left.

That's a 30-point game for P5."
Years of the Fournier/Vučević teams not being able to draw fouls has me unaccustomed to the regular Banchero/FWagner FT parade
"Alright, I’m buying stock in Anthony Black. That dude has the juice."
"Fourth Quarter Franz

#FQF"
"Halftime: Magic 66, Jazz 58

Orlando closes the half on a 16-5 run.

Wendell Carter Jr. has 14 pts and 6 rebs. Paolo Banchero notched 12 pts, 6 rebs, 2 asts, 2 stls and 1 blk."
There’s absolutely nothing there. He fell pretty hard and obviously you want him to be ok but there’s nothing there. Jeez.
"Anthony Black checks in for the @OrlandoMagic.

Jalen Suggs has 3 fouls. Paolo Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr. each have 2."
Joe Ingles giving me Al-Farouq Aminu flashbacks
can't shake the thought that it'd be a good bit if Victor Wembanyama just periodically showed up to the arena dressed as Slenderman and insisted that's just how he dresses.
"NEWS: The #Magic say Markelle Fultz will not play tonight at Utah due to left knee swelling.

Gary Harris will start in his place, the team said."
"“The party’s just getting started. But, they’re going to get all of their guys in uniform. We're going to see them three more times. It should be fun each time.”

On the Lakers holding off the Clippers in OT to snap 11-game losing streak in rivalry:  ocregister.com/2023/11/01/lak…"
Darvin Ham says Taurean Prince sitting because of left knee soreness was precautionary.
"Final (OT): Lakers 130, Clippers 125.

Christian Wood with the emphatic putback to secure the victory for the Lakers. 

The Lakers' regular-season losing streak to the Clippers is over, ending at 11 consecutive games."
And now Norman Powell has fouled out.
"Ty Lue is challenging that foul called on Paul George, which would be his 6th penalty."
"Darvin Ham is challenging the shooting foul called against Cam Reddish, who was assessed a foul on Paul George's potential game-tying 3-pointer."
"First 30-point game for LeBron James this season: he's up to 32 points after that stepback 3 with less than five minutes left. 

Lakers leading 108-100 with 4:40 remaining."
"LeBron James with the pull-up 2 in semi-transition, putting the Lakers up 100-95 over the Clippers with 7:32 in 4Q. 

LeBron: 27 points, 8 rebounds, 5 assists. 

Anthony Davis: 20 points, 8 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 blocks, 2 steals. D'Angelo Russell: 22 points, 6 assists."
"End of 3Q: Lakers 87, Clippers 85. 

Lakers went on a 15-5 run in the final 4:22 of the quarter -- when Anthony Davis, Christian Wood and Jaxson Hayes shared the floor. 

Length/size seemed to bother Clippers, who shot 2-9 in that span."
The Lakers went from three-guard lineups last year to three-big lineups this season.
"The Lakers' minutes with the triple big frontcourt of Christian Wood-Anthony Davis-Jaxson Hayes has been successful: Lakers on a 9-2 run since Hayes subbed into the game and that trio started playing together. 

Clippers 82-81 with 1:46 in 3Q."
Lakers on a 9-2 run after that Cam Reddish steal that led to the D’Angelo Russell layup in transition; Clippers 72-63 with 8:04 in the 3Q.
Taurean Prince has officially been ruled out for tonight's game.
"Halftime: Clippers 61, Lakers 48.

LeBron James: 17 points (6-9, 2-5 on 3s), 3 rebounds.

Kawhi Leonard: 22 points (8-12, 4-6 on 3s), 4 assists

Russell Westbrook: 13 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists.

Clippers with 30 PITP and shooting 50% on 3s (7-14)."
"End of 3Q: Clippers 37, Lakers 24. 

Max Christie with a corner 3 to close out the quarter. 6-0 run to close out the first by the Lakers, who trailed by 19 at one point. Clippers shooting 69.6% (16-23) from the field and 55.6% (5-9) on 3s."
"Clippers 37-18 with 1:10 in 1Q after Norman Powell’s layup.

Kawhi Leonard (18) has as many points as the Lakers do as a team."
