"Nick Nurse asked about Tyrese Maxey‚Äôs bounce back and 22-5-10 line in the second half after a slow start. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not enough‚Äù

"Initial observations on another well-balanced Sixers win, their fourth straight:

nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nba/philadelph‚Ä¶"
"Sixers win 112-100. Leading by 5 through 3 quarters and Durant coming in as Embiid was coming out, they pull away in the fourth and don't even have to bring the reigning MVP back in.

They are 4-1. Their point differential is 12.2, tied for 2nd best in the NBA behind Boston."

"4 straight Ws for the Sixers.

Says a lot that I thought Maxey was off for a lot of the night and he ends with 22-5-10 and led the closing kick to keep Embiid on the bench in the 4th. Excellent stuff.

Instant observations @PHLY_Sports 

allphly.com/instant-observ‚Ä¶"
"FINAL: Sixers 112, Suns 100. Embiid with 26 and 11. Oubre with 25 points. Harris with 18 and 10. Maxey with 22 and 10 assists. Suns, who were playing without Booker and Beal, shot 36 percent from the floor. 

Sixers are 4-1. Up next: Monday vs. Washington."

"What felt like a subpar day for Maxey has turned into 22 points on 50 percent shooting, 10 assists and five rebounds."
"Sixers legend Saben Lee now in the game for the Suns, who have emptied their bench down 106-91 with less than four to play."
"Maxey finds Reed in the short roll, finger rolls a layup to put the Sixers up 15 and force a Suns timeout. They've silenced Durant in the fourth quarter thus far. Reed staying in, Embiid might not have to come back in."
They just showed a man dressed as Santa on the video board and I will not stand for this Thanksgiving erasure.
"Maxey has struggled with his shot today, but has two big buckets in the fourth quarter. Finished at the rim and just hit a three to put the Sixers up 99-86 with less than seven to play."
Sixers' lead back out to double digits at 92-82 after that bucket by Reed with 8:27 to play. Korkmaz also has five points during this stretch for the bench's first points.
"With Durant on the court and Embiid resting, the Sixers have opened this game up a bit. Philly up 10 with 8:27 to go. Significant swing with the big guy on the bench."
Philly gets its 1st bench points of the game on that Furkan Korkmaz layup to start the 4th Q. Philly leads it 82-75 early in the 4th. #Sixers
"Nurse was hoping to make a slight change to the rotation. Paul Reed was ready to check in with over 2 mins in third. Next dead ball was too late. 

Wonder if Nurse anticipated a slugfest in fourth and hoped to extend Embiid's minutes then by giving him an earlier rest than usual."
"Sixers 80, Suns 75 at the end of the third after Embiid's wild three in the final seconds. Sixers led by as many as 14 in that period but let the Suns get back into it. Embiid has 26 and 11. Oubre with 23. But Sixers have ZERO bench points."
Sixers have a 80-75 lead over the Suns through three quarters despite trailing 18-0 in bench scoring.
One stat that‚Äôs a little concerning here with 2:28 to go in the 3rd Q: Philly has 0 bench points #Sixers
"Looked like the Sixers were creating the necessary separation, but Suns are hanging around. KD is up to 20 points after that jumper to cut Philly's lead to 74-69 with about three minutes to play in the third."
"Melton's early-season shooting struggles continuing this afternoon. He's 3-of-10 from the floor, including two point-blank misses from three on that last possession."
"Embiid slams on Drew Eubanks and gets the foul.

To avoid another fine, he did not do the chop. He just got up, looked at the crowd, put his hands on his head, and snapped his fingers"
Breaking: Embiid is taking advantage of the mismatch with Drew Eubanks.
"Credit to Kelly Oubre, who said in training camp that he didn't plan on fitting in, but standing out -- and then actually did it. 

Leads Sixers w/ 20 thus far. 45.5% from 3 on 5.5 attempts per game. On a minimum deal.

Oh, and ""Tsunami Papi"" is a top 5 nickname in the league."
"It's a shame Danuel House is out of the rotation, depriving us of the House vs Eubanks ""they tampered for these guys?"" bowl."
"Halftime reading after another hot-shooting half for Kelly Oubre, who so far is making the most of his opportunity with the Sixers 

inquirer.com/sixers/sixers-‚Ä¶"
"A down half from Embiid (3-9 fg, 4 TOs) and Maxey (4-12 fg, 0-3 from 3), but the Sixers' dependable, reliable, impact forward tandem of Kelly Oubre Jr (17 on 7-10) and Tobias Harris (12 on 4-6) are keeping them afloat. 

52-45 Sixers lead at the half."
"Kelly Oubre Jr. needs just three more points to keep his season average at 20.

He's the game's top scorer at halftime of Sixers-Suns with 17 points on 7-for-10 shooting. Sixers lead by seven."
The Sixers lead 52-45 at the half.
Kelly Oubre Jr. caps off a terrific 1st half with a layup. He‚Äôs up to 17 points and Philly has a 52-45 lead over the Suns at the half. #Sixers
Another awesome Kelly Oubre half in a season that is quickly becoming filled with those. Leading all scorers with 17 and helping to make up for tough starts for Embiid and Maxey
"Halftime: Sixers 52, Suns 45. Oubre with 17 points on 7-of-10 shooting. Harris with 12 and 7. Embiid with 11 points on 3-of-9 FG. Maxey is 4-of-12 from the floor but has five assists. Suns are shooting just 33.3 percent from the floor."
"Maxey is overpassing today which is compounding the bad shooting start, would rather live with a bad volume shooting game from him than have him play timid"
"Joel Embiid gets a flagrant 1 after elbowing Jusuf Nurkic in the mouth as he tried to gather the ball in transition. A load of garbage, but a flagrant 1 foul."
Joel Embiid called for a flagrant foul 1 on his offensive foul with 3:45 left in the first half:
Flagrant 1 foul for Embiid.
Joel Embiid was called for an offensive foul as Jusuf Nurkic took a hit on that drive from the big fella. The play is now being reviewed for a possible flagrant foul. #Sixers
"I love the occasional 1 p.m. Sixers start, but haha, this is about as ugly as NBA basketball gets."
"Jaden Springer has had a tougher time to start the season than most of us hoped following the preseason, but I really appreciate how he attacks rebound opportunities. Guys just go flying off of him"
"If either of these teams can figure out how to teleport the ball around the court so that they don't have to dribble, game over."
"Sixers have eight turnovers, but Suns have parlayed those into only five points. They're shooting 9-of-29 from the floor and 3-of-14 from deep."
