"Cool to see former-Wolf Matt Ryan find a role in New Orleans.

Ryan got his first career start in the Pels last game, and hit three 3s in the first 5 minutes — he was pumped about it. Ryan already has 14 made 3s on the year. pic.twitter.com/Eouc87pBpR"
"The #Vikings, Lions, Raiders, Texans, Falcons, Bills, and Jaguars will get in-person scouting looks today at Huntington Bank Stadium of TE Brevyn Spann-Ford and other #Gophers plus Illinois players. pic.twitter.com/KpaAMR7xjL"
"Wolves will debut their City edition uniforms on Saturday night. Took a boat ride with Naz Reid this summer for an up close look at the rollout in a story that holds up pretty, pretty well right now. theathletic.com/4773840/2023/0…"
"Are all in-season tournament games free on league pass? Feels like a no-brainer.

What’s the cost of that vs the cost of that weird Oceans 11-style commercial with the dude from White Lotus?"
Congrats to Park Center senior guard Casmir “Cash” Chavis on his commitment to Washington. Was fun seeing his announcement in-person. He visited the Huskies a couple weeks ago and fell in love. Gets to play the #Gophers + others nearby with Washington’s 2024 move to the Big Ten. pic.twitter.com/jR711dR4mN
"Anthony Edwards is tied for fourth-most midrange shots per game so far this season at 5.8 per game. He is shooting 34.8% on those. 

He is taking 6 threes per game and is shooting 54%."
Some thoughts from Wolves head coach Chris Finch after practice today. The Wolves have three more home games on this homestand before their first in-season tourney game one week from tonight at San Antonio. pic.twitter.com/VenklXnP1U
"Couple Jaden McDaniels quotes from practice today.   

On the defense: ""Me, Rudy in pick and roll, I feel like it’s dangerous.""  

On his flagrant foul: ""It is what it is. They ain’t take my money, I don’t think. So I don’t care."""
"Couple Jaden McDaniles quotes from practice today. 

On the defense: ""Me, Rudy in pick and roll, I feel like it’s dangerous.""

On his flagrant foul of Jamal Murray: ""It is what it is. They ain’t take my money, I don’t think. So I don’t care."""
No one stops Nikola Jokic. But the Timberwolves believe they are equipped to at least make things tough on him. We saw that last night.  theathletic.com/5022568/2023/1…
"Last night I had a dream I ate dinner with @taylorswift13. She said I was hysterical & wanted to talk to me all night.

It was karma from my dream a few weeks ago. I saved her from paparazzi in the grocery story. 
Kindness always pays off…even in your wildest dreams."
Chris Finch said there’s something constantly on his mind related to what the team is asking of Karl-Anthony Towns. Have a read here about that and how Towns has navigated some early offensive struggles: startribune.com/karl-anthony-t…

"When Denver tried to make a push in the third quarter, the Wolves made an important adjustment on how their offense operated from Monday night to prevent another collapse read about it here: startribune.com/timberwolves-s…"
"A lot of talk in the locker room last night about Jaden McDaniels' impact. Gave Murray fits on defense, grabbed 9 boards and I really like the way he's moving offensively. Finch talked about getting him more touches."
"After hammering Nuggets, the Timberwolves showed their full potential. Now they begin chasing the elusive consistency theathletic.com/5022568/2023/1…"
"KAT on defending Jokic: ""I’m happy that I was able to make things difficult for him. You’re never fully going to be able to stop a player of that caliber. But you make it very tough on him all night and that’s what I wanted to do."""
"Anthony Edwards when talking about Naz Reid tonight said: “For some reason, it seems like when he posts up he's scoring every time now. I don't know if it's because he's been in the weight room but I'm liking it. I'm loving it, actually. “

"Anthony Edwards when asked what the Wolves need to do to stay consistent:

""Starting with myself, just can't come out being selfish, worrying about however many points I wanna score. Just playing within the game, playing within the flow, I think that's the main thing with me. I…"
"Chris Finch on KAT: ""I always think about it. He’s an All-NBA player that we asked to move positions, and he’s still adapting. All credit to him. It’s not easy. He’s been great about it, and I know it’s at times been frustrating, but he’s learning a little bit more every day."""
"We have a new nickname for Mike Conley from Anthony Edwards: ""bite bite""

""His nickname bite bite, so I call him bite bite because he looks like he's ready to bite something."""
"Anthony Edwards when asked about the job Jaden McDaniels did guarding Jamal Murray tonight:

""Defensive Player of the Year, for sure."""
"Anthony Edwards: “Mike Conley came through big in the third quarter for sure. His nickname 'Bite Bite' so I call him Bite Bite.""

Q: Why’s that?

Ant: ""Cause he look like he’s ready to bite something. Bite Bite came through big tonight."""
"KAT played really well on both ends, Edwards was explosive when needed and patient when needed, Gobert was awesome defensively and Conley ran the show. 

This is what they are capable of. Now they have to build on it"
"MIN 110, DEN 89.

Really good win for the Wolves, who were great on both ends to give the Nuggets their first loss. Needed bounce back from Saturday"
What a bizarre team
"Denver waves the white flag down by 23 with 6:21 to go -- Malone pulls the starters

As bad as Monday was in Atlanta, gotta give it to the Wolves -- handled Denver end-to-end tonight. Really rolled in this one."
"When things got hairy in that quarter, Conley and Kyle Anderson settled it down on offense. Key difference from Monday night. Wolves lead 89-72 after three as a result."
Finch with another timeout as Denver cuts it to 14. Nuggets are starting to cook offensively. Not for a lack of effort on defense from the Wolves. This is what they do.
"A healthier Mike Conley tonight making a huge difference in staving off the Denver comeback, for now. Murray has hit 5 of his last 6."
Pretty sure McDaniels just picked up 4 fouls in 6 or 7 minutes of play. Has to head to the bench.
Wolves lead down to 16. Finch calls timeout. Couple bad possessions offensively prompts the call.
"Jaden McDaniels picks up two quick fouls, the second one a frustration foul (pushing Murray in the back) that can't happen."

"After keeping Trae Young in check in his season debut, Jaden McDaniels held Jamal Murray to 2 points in the first half here tonight (0 for 9 shooting).

Wolves up on the Nuggets 63-44 at half"
The Timberwolves again enter halftime with a 19-point lead. What could possibly go wrong?
"KAT sitting the rest of the half, his best of the season at both ends. 15 points and good defense on Jokic."
Jamal Murray 0-for-9. 0 points. Part of that was Jaden McDaniels island early. But he also can't get anything to go.
"Towns with a couple good postups on Gordon and Murray, being physical without fouling and making Denver pay for the mismatch. He's up to 15."
Timberwolves lead 28-21 after one. Edwards with 10. Jokic started to get going once Towns got in foul trouble and what was a 14-point Wolves lead is seven.
The paying customers are enjoying the way the refs are officiating plays involving Nikola Jokic.
