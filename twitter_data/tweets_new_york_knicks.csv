"Touchdown, Rutgers. 19-yard pass from Gavin Wimsatt to JaQuae Jackson. That's Jackson's first touchdown of the season. Scarlet Knights cut their deficit to 21-16 with 14:07 to go in the fourth quarter."
"Rutgers is up 9-7 at the half on the No. 1 team in the country, and the band is playing the Spice Girls at halftime. Just running up the score now. pic.twitter.com/3vWTTBqGwD"
Kyle Monangai has now run for 100 yards in three straight games. It's his fifth 100-yard game of the season.
"Jai Patel kicks a 20-yard field goal to give Rutgers a 9-7 lead at halftime.
The Scarlet Knights will get the ball to start the second half."
Wow. Mohamed Toure intercepts Kyle McCord. Rutgers will get the ball at the Ohio State 46

"Nets say Ben Simmons, Nic Claxton and Cam Johnson are all out today against the Celtics"
That was great coverage by Eric Rogers on Marvin Harrison Jr. to break up that third-down pass
"Touchdown, Ohio State. McCord with a 14-yard pass to Gee Scott Jr. 7-0 Buckeyes with 8:35 to go in the first quarter."

"Guess the worst thing you could say about the way things are going for Randle is that @cleantheglass does not list him as performing worse than typical when he shoots 5-20, 1-9 from 3. pic.twitter.com/Jy0EGexRET"

"NEW: Amid extended shooting slump, Julius Randle calls for less isolation and pick-and-roll play: “I think there are some things we can do different.” #Knicks #NBA @NYDailyNews @NYDNSports nydailynews.com/2023/11/03/jul…"
"Talked to @mmargaux8 about Knicks falling to 2-4, Jalen Brunson’s scoring vs. MIL (he scored or assisted on 55 of NYK’s 105 points on Friday); Julius Randle & more pic.twitter.com/2SVsImZCXY"
"Julius Randle: ""I’m just not in rhythm. Not in rhythm, everything just seems a little bit off, you just start pressing a little bit, but like I said, I’ve just gotta stay with it. Keep working."" Randle also reiterated he's ""seeing a lot of bodies"" down low on his drives."

"Thibs is more animated tonight than I've seen him in a minute. Saying he wants guys to ""trust the pass"" and that players can't predetermine what they do. Didn't name any names."
"Final: Bucks 110, Knicks 105.

Knicks fall to 2-4 on the season.

• Brunson 45-5-4
• Grimes 17 & 4
• Randle 16-12-5, 5-20 FGs
• Robinson 15 rebs (6 off)
• Lillard 30-4-4
• Giannis 22-8-6"
I know the Randle iso on Giannis worked on the couple of previous possessions but the Knicks have to find something better than that on two consecutive plays that led to misses at the rim.
Damian Lillard with a casual six points in 12 seconds
"Huge 3 from Jalen Brunson gives the Knicks a 103-101 lead over the Bucks here in Milwaukee. This has been an ugly game, but it looks like the Knicks live for ugly games. Now they have a chance to shock a title contender on their own home floor."
Jalen Brunson is one heck of a basketball player.
Julius Randle arrived just in time. Knicks down just one point with a minute and a half to go in Milwaukee.
"If you told me Julius Randle would shoot 4-of-17 from the field but the Knicks would still be in position to have a shot to beat the Bucks in crunch time, I wouldn't believe you.

Yet here we are: Jalen Brunson has 40, and the Knicks are going toe-to-toe with a title contender."
"For those confused about how the in-season tournament works, this is a really good explainer: youtube.com/watch?v=yFOvld…"
"I think the in-season tournament should lead into the insane courts. For each in-season tournament game you lose, you have to play on an increasingly hideous court."
Jalen Brunson has 40. He's 9-for-9 in the paint.
Jalen Brunson has tied the all-time record for most points scored in an in-season tournament game with 38
Jalen Brunson is keeping the Knicks in this game. Brunson with 30 points on 11-of-19 shooting. All other Knicks have combined to shoot worse than 30 percent from the field.
"Through three quarters, the Bucks lead the Knicks 82-76.

• Brunson 30 & 4
• Grimes 14 pts
• Randle 11-10-3, 3-15 FGs
• Giannis 13-6-5
• Lillard 15-4-4"
There are too many game stoppages in the NBA.
"Bucks have speed painters on the court at halftime and I have two thoughts: first of course, paint the court. Second, are we overrating the masters because I've never seen them do back flips while painting."
"Halftime. Bucks lead the Knicks 56-46.

• Brunson 16 pts
• Randle 11 & 9, 3-14 FGs
• Grimes 11-3-2
• Antetokounmpo 10-4-4

Knicks are shooting 31-33-58."
Excellent defense by Quentin Grimes forces Damian Lillard into traveling while attempting to pass out of a heavily contested side-step 3. Lillard is 2/6 from the field for 9 points. Grimes has been excellent guard every opponent's best player this season. He is also 3/5 3PT
I fell asleep at the wheel. It was Hart's third foul. Take me out back and turn me into glue.
