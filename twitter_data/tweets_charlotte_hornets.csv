"Charlotte with a huge rest advantage ahead of tonight‚Äôs Indiana game. Pacers played a tough game last night vs Cleveland, Charlotte had a full free day and practiced in INDY. M

No excuses for starting slow or not executing the game plan."

James Harden sounds more like Kanye every time he gets in front of a mic and feels empowered.
Have a #Hornets question for mailbag consideration? Hit me with it.
"Rewatching yesterdays game. This was a killer of a play. 

Thor with poor ball denial on the inbounder, Ball then a step slow reacting and navigating the screen. Brooks able to catch and shoot in rhythm.

It‚Äôs small details like this that are adding up on film for Charlotte. pic.twitter.com/QU5jn1Goi3"
"#Hornets gave up 1.13 PPP in the half court to the Rockets last night, who, coming into the game were scoring 0.9 PPP in half court possessions thru 3 games. Wow. pic.twitter.com/SeFiEktJDD"

"Should there be concern about LaMelo? I spoke with him after the #Hornets latest loss.

‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt hoop in a minute,"" he told me, ""so it‚Äôs just conditioning and getting all that back and everything.""

More from LaMelo and the Hornets after another defeat:

"Watching Warriors-Kings is like a different sport at times, such crisp ball movement and decision making. Fantastic end to the game with big shots on both sides, Klay Thompson closes with the midrange game winner"
"‚ÄúWe just shot 50% from the field, 41% from three on the road and lost, that‚Äôs crazy. Our defense was awful, from pick and roll coverages to stuff we worked on for two days, they made us pay.‚Äù - Steve Clifford pic.twitter.com/8bXwpxuVEd"
"Steve Clifford 

""The worst thing you can do is overreact, we've played 4 games. The level of competition goes up, maybe that's what we need""

A very brief post-game media availability."
"Final: Rockets 128, #Hornets 119

PJ Washington 23 pts, 3 rebs
Terry Rozier 21 pts, 6 asts, 3 rebs
LaMelo 19 pts, 5 asts

That's 3 straight losses after beating Atlanta

Up next: at Indiana on Saturday"
"Thick skin is required for Hornets fans. All things considered, a disappointing 1-3 start to the season with a very soft schedule. 

Hornets have barely led in 4 games, they‚Äôre always playing catch-up from behind. The early season returns are concerning."
Season-best 19 made 3-pointers for the Rockets tonight. Really poor defensive rotations again by the #Hornets. Going to take a mad run to win this. They're down 106-92 with 6:24 remaining.
"End of 3rd Q: Rockets 86, #Hornets 78"
"Halftime: Rockets 61, #Hornets 58

PJ Washington 14 pts, 2 rebs
Gordon Hayward 12 pts, 3 rebs, 3 asts"
#Hornets are on a 21-5 run and have cut the Rockets lead to 58-56 with 1:22 left in the first half.
Three fouls on Brandon Miller with 10:59 left in the second quarter. He's out until the third quarter.
Houston just put up 39 points in the first quarter. The Rockets are 0-3. Not much more needs to be said.  #Hornets in a 12-point hole to start the second quarter.
Theo is struggling. #Hornets have to get some quality minutes out of the backup point guard spot and it ain't happening.
"Same old story, bad offensive decision making leaving the transition defense in a no win situation for back to back transition finishes. Too many easy baskets, plus Houston shooting a very good ball early"
First player off the bench tonight: Brandon Miller.
"Hot start by both teams, Houston‚Äôs shot diet has been tougher than Charlotte‚Äôs so far."
Will LaMelo start a new streak tonight after having his 53-game span snapped on Monday? pic.twitter.com/esuCkfoEsq
Earth to @nba. You have to step in w/ this @BallySports stuff. Actual fans can‚Äôt see your product. Very pathetic.
Somehow we have a must win for both teams in game 4 of 82. The NBA is back. pic.twitter.com/crncjprhwr
"If Brandon Miller keeps playing this well, and the Hornets continue to start 1st quarters poorly, it only seems a matter of time until he starts. 

Clifford has discussed how the 1st quarter is the most important in determining the outcome of games. To give yourself the best‚Ä¶"
"Charlotte has actually been a pretty good half court DEF team (90.9 per 100, 12th), but TOV's (15.1%, 18th) + transition DEF following TOV's (1.47 PPP, 18th) + transition DEF off live DREB (1.47 PPP, 29th) have torpedoed the DEF overall (112.1, 15th)."
"Remember how vilified then head coach James Borrego was for not gifting minutes to James Bouknight as a rookie?

Where is that energy taking ownership of their abhorrent misjudgment? Some people owe an apology, but they‚Äôre the type to never own their mistakes."
"James Bouknight's Journey To Becoming an Afterthought üîó

"I will have an article for @All_Hornets on Bouknight dropping soon, it was already 75% pre-written in expectation of the option being declined."
"#Hornets are not exercising the fourth-year option in James Bouknight's contract, league sources told @theobserver. But they are picking up Mark Williams' third-year option.

"LaMelo Ball shooting thru 3 games:

34.7% USG
11-44 FG: 25%
5-16 RIM FG: 31%
6-24 3FG: 25%"
We will know by the end of today if James Bouknight has his team option picked up for 2024/25.
"The Hornets are one loss away against the Rockets from going 1-3 with an easy schedule. 

The last two games Charlotte have ended up playing the other team‚Äôs game. What is the identity of the Hornets? A Steve Clifford team that is turning the ball over and has poor transition D"
"""We know what we are capable of and we are not doing that right now.""

‚ÄúLook, we just played two terrific defensive games. So it‚Äôs not like we haven‚Äôt been good on defense.""

‚ÄúI think the performance was great, but at the end of the day we lost.""

Brandon Miller 22 pts, 9 rebs
Mark Williams 18 pts,7 rebs

"Brandon Miller has a career-best 22 points, but #Hornets can't get any stops defensively. Nets lead 106-94 with 8 minutes remaining."
"End of 3rd Q: Nets 99, #Hornets 83"
"Halftime: Nets 66, #Hornets 55

Brandon Miller 16 pts, 3 rebs
Mark Williams 12 pts, 6 rebs
Terry Rozier 12 pts, 5 asts"
Brandon Miller is averaging 15 points a game. He has 13 already with 4:47 left before halftime. Easily been the best bright spot on an otherwise dim night for the #Hornets.
