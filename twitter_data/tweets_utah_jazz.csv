"Rudy Gobert is back to being Rudy Gobert on defense

This year he is defending 6.5 shots a game inside 6 feet and teams are shooting 14.5% below average

Last year it was 7.5 shots a game and 7.8% below average

Last year in Utah was 7.5 shots and 13.1% below average pic.twitter.com/kRLVl9xXtD"

Not every hit that just looks violent should be reviewed for targeting!

"Whatâ€™s wrong with Walker Kessler? The Utah Jazzâ€™s fun-loving big man has a theory. He concedes heâ€™s been weighed down a bit by big expectations, an imperfect stint with Team USA, and some on-court indecision, but has vowed to find the joy in playing again. sltrib.com/sports/jazz/20â€¦"

Friday,Â November 10th
Jazz v. Grizzlies 
Suns v. Lakers"
"Reading between the lines, sounds like the Nuggets are going to at the very least be careful with Jamal Murray tomorrow night against the Bulls. Chance he doesnâ€™t play"
"The Nuggets defeat Dallas 125-114, and improve to 5-1 on the young season. They win their inaugural in season tournament game, and take a 1-0 record in group B. Nikola Jokic stars, MPJ with a terrific game, and the Nuggets lead from almost start to finish. On to Chicago tomorrow"
Nuggets have about 8 points tonight from rebounds that have slipped out of a Dallas players' hand and right into their hands
"Luka's gonna get his numbers, but MPJ and Denver have defended him about as well as you can reasonably expect to"
MPJ for three at the end of the third quarter and the Nuggets lead Dallas 102-87.....Denver has scored six points to end quarters.....difference between this game being at 9 or 15
"Nikola JokiÄ‡ has 27 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists......

There are two minutes remaining in the third quarter"
"I've been critical of MPJ in the past, but he deserves all of the flowers for the way he's embraced being a 3 and D guy this season.  I'm not sure there have been many wings this season better than he has been on the defensive end. He's played with zero ego this season"
"I'm not sure there is an answer, and I do think Dallas is trying to protect Lively some, but....Grant Williams doesn't have a prayer against Nikola JokiÄ‡"
Second half about to start here in Denver.....Nuggets emphasized playing better basketball than what they showed on Wednesday in Minnesota at shootaround.....First half was exactly that
Fans watching at home really miss out by not being able to hear the Nuggets PA guy announce opposing free throw shooters names.
"Nikola JokiÄ‡ ends the half with a three, he has 20 and 8 rebounds and 5 assists and the Nuggets lead Dallas 70-55 at halftime.....Jokic was absurd in the second quarter"
Denver got Luka in the depths of hell
I've been VERY impressed by Zeke Nnaji this season....
Denver shot 14-of-20 from the field in the first quarter and went 6-7 from 3-point range....The Nuggets out rebounded Dallas 11-4....
"End of the first quarter: The Nuggets lead the Mavericks 40-24.......Pretty overwhelming quarter from Denver...When they turn it on, the Nuggets are really difficult to deal with. Breaking news"
Good gracious what a block by Peyton Watson
Denver's come out flying tonight. The Nuggets hold a 33-19 lead over Dallas with 3:36 remaining in the first quarter. Dallas is having real trouble running clean offense and getting good looks. The Nuggets are forcing turnovers and converting in transition
6:44 remaining in the first quarter. The Nuggets lead the Mavericks 19-14.....Denver playing these first five minutes with real purpose. The Nuggets were ticked by their performance on Wednesday night in Minnesota. Offense is a lot more crisp tonight
Mavericks starting with the length of Derrick Jones Jr. on Jamal Murray and just doubled Nikola JokiÄ‡ on the catch on the first possession
"In Denver tonight, covering Nuggets/Mavs.....Ball Arena hopping....should be a fun one"
Chet Holmgren just ran a 5-1 pick and fade to Isaiah Joe as the ball handler.....Him and Wemby are not normal
Quick someone tell me how much longer I have to deal with Julius randle
"Yeah, **** it. Iâ€™m in on the courts. Wacky = fun."
"Cmon Julius Randle, at least try"
"I really donâ€™t know what to think about the courts. Like, I might love them?
But they also might give me a seizureâ€¦
Not mutually exclusive."
