#Browns have elevated WR James Proche II to the active roster from the practice squad
"It was another loss for #Cavs in Indiana last night. There was lots of ugly. But with Jarrett Allen & Darius Garland back, they came away encouraged, thinking about what they can finally become.

‚ÄúWhen we get it pieced together, it‚Äôs going to be trouble‚Äù

"For #Cavs, there was an abundance of ugly on Friday night. But the expected starting lineup was as advertised. And they had their ""spirit"" back as Jarrett Allen made his season debut. Now they can start building & figuring out who they can become

"#Cavs Donovan Mitchell on another loss and a disappointing 2-4 start: 

‚ÄúThis loss sucks. Wasn‚Äôt a great performance. But not dwelling on it. Not sitting here sulking about it. I think we are in a good headspace as a group. Nothing to overreact about"""
"#Cavs finally got a chance to use their expected Opening Night starting lineup on Friday. Early on, it looked like a group of guys who had never played together before. By the time, they figured it out, it was too late

Not sure why that play was drawn up for someone other than Donovan Mitchell‚Ä¶
That was an awesome bounce back quarter for the Cavs. Thought Evan Mobley did a lot of really good stuff there.
Well well well. We have a two-point game. #Cavs have surged here in the third quarter -- and Donovan Mitchell is spectacular.
SO MANY of #Cavs Evan Mobley's misses are front-rimmed short. It's like he pulled the string on himself. He has been working on getting the ball up higher on his release. But it's still not getting there.
Little frustration for #Cavs tonight. Darius Garland has a technical foul already. Now Max Strus does as well.
The electric blue court seems to be providing some issues already. Two guys have slipped and they keep having to bring the brooms out to wipe it off. More so than usual.
"After five games, #Cavs will finally be able to unleash their expected Opening Night starting lineup. Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen are both back tonight, sources tell @clevelanddotcom. It's Allen's season debut.

"Two #Cavs players used the same descriptor when I asked them about the court tonight in Indiana: ""Disgusting"""
#Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said he doesn‚Äôt know yet if Darius Garland or Jarrett Allen will play tonight here in Indy.

"That the Steelers are 5-3 is a testament to culture, mental and physical toughness, defense and a head coach too many of their own fans don't appreciate"

#Browns have signed T Leroy Watson to their active roster. He spent this season on the 49ers' practice squad.
"After a week of slippage on the defensive end of the floor, #Cavs had a team meeting, film session & walkthrough at the team hotel. They were challenged to pick it up at that end of the floor. Then they delivered their best effort in quite some time

"Coming off another ugly loss against New York and in the face of a losing streak, #Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff issued a challenge to his team. Then they recaptured their identity and sent a reminder of who they are -- a suffocating defense-first team

"#Cavs had lost 4 straight against NY. They hadn't won at Madison Square Garden in about a year and a half. Both streaks are over

‚ÄúIt feels special winning here. I don‚Äôt remember the last time we won here. It feels great to get that monkey off our back""

"CAVS WIN! Cleveland takes the back-to-back over New York at Madison Square Garden, 95-89. #Cavs cleveland.com/cavs/2023/11/c‚Ä¶"
#Cavs Donovan Mitchell is 0 for the second half and he looks exhausted.
#Cavs have opened a seven-point lead here late in the third quarter. Their biggest lead over the Knicks since Game 2 of the playoff series last April.
#Cavs Isaac Okoro with his fourth foul of the first half. No ideal on a night when he is supposed to have the Jalen Brunson matchup.
#Cavs Tristan Thompson is the first Cavalier not named Donovan Mitchell to score tonight. Who had that on their bingo card?
"Knicks - 14, Donovan Mitchell - 13. No one else for #Cavs has scored."
Two teams are a combined 4 of 20 from the field in the first five minutes.
