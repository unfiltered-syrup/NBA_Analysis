It’s Nov. 4 @SIRIUSXM where are my Christmas channels? There’s only so much @TermineRadio a person can take!
Let me just quickly note that the Heat are shooting 39% from three so far this season
"Tyler Herro is shooting 58.8 percent on catch-and-shoot threes (2.8 attempts per game) and 38.2 percent on pull-up threes (5.7 attempts per game) this season.

His versatility as an outside shooter remains one of his biggest strengths."
"Jaime Jaquez really has a unique way of putting pressure on the rim

Stutters and jabs pre-dribble (1st clip)

Getting a head of steam before the catch (2nd clip)

Pure physicality to challenge defenders at the rim (3rd clip)

They’ve needed that element pic.twitter.com/TmxWEjeygn"

"Sure Tyler Herro was 1 assist short of a triple-double Friday night, but that’s not why his play-making impressed 

He controlled the entire game based off how the Wizards reacted to him

And well, he forced them to keep cycling through different coverages
