The Bulls  and United Center staffs did a fabulous job with their attention to detail making sure the prep work  matched the hype and build up of the long anticipated  S.I. Tournament event. Thank you @chicagobulls @UnitedCenter I am proud to be a Bulls employee-total respect.
"Mayberry: The career Zach LaVine craves is obtainable, but how much does he want it?  theathletic.com/5030062/2023/1…"
"Happy Saturday! Remember, kindness never takes a day off. Have a beautiful weekend."
"Zach LaVine on his potential game-tying jumper in tonight’s Bulls’ loss to Brooklyn:

“It was a pretty good shot for a Hail Mary free throw,” LaVine said. pic.twitter.com/Upvco3KjiO"

"Bucks coach Adrian Griffin after tonight's win vs NYK: ""Sometimes as coaches we’re too smart for our own selves. A couple players came to me, they wanted Brook [Lopez] deeper in a drop. I was smart enough to listen to them. It paid off tonight”

Brook Lopez had 8 blocks tonight"
"Watch Caruso here. One possession game, under a minute left. Nets tried to screen him four times to set something up for Bridges. They wasted a ton of clock and had to heave up a prayer. pic.twitter.com/rGsLOe0QLT"
"In-Season Tournament Final: Nets 109, Bulls 107

Zach LaVine had a tough final three minutes with misses and defensive miscues. But he had a chance at a game-tying jumper. It hit back rim and Brooklyn escapes."
Ben Simmons did not want to go to the line. Was weird to see him still in for this last possession. Bulls almost stole one when he tipped it out. pic.twitter.com/dWA5I9aHr1

"Wow. LaVine successfully misses the second free throw, Bulls successfully snag the rebound, but Zach can't land a last-second 3-point attempt. Probably had another second to take a less rushed shot.

Nets win 109-107."
"Bridges misses the second free throw, Bulls get the timeout.

109-106 with 10.8 seconds left.

Of course it wasn't going to be a calm finish."
"Zach LaVine misses a chance at the rim to tie the game. Bulls forced to foul, trailing by two with 12 seconds remaining."
"Bulls defense forces a shot clock violation with 37.9 seconds remaining. Trailing 108-106.

Critical moment here. Whole arena on their feet."
"Bulls running ""two side"" (stagger for DeRozan into side pick-and-roll) out of the timeout to try and get Cam Thomas switched onto DeRozan. Has been their go-to play down the stretch. pic.twitter.com/yRa349jvpE"
The Bulls were 9-for-17 from 3-point range in the first half. They have missed all 9 of their attempts behind the arc in the second half.
Season-high 10 points for Patrick Williams. #Bulls trail Nets 93-90 with 7:13 remaining.
"Patrick Williams was pulled from the starting lineup only six games into the season.

This had been coming since opening night – maybe earlier. It marks a critical crossroad for Williams as he faces down a contract year. chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/c…"

Bulls just gave up three consecutive offensive rebounds to allow the Nets to score two points.
DeMar DeRozan has now airballed two 3-pointers tonight. Hit his first two of the game.
"#Bulls trail Brooklyn 59-58 at half. Bulls are 9-18 from 3, Nets 11-21. DeRozan seems to be OK, has 14 pts, LaVine 13, White 10. Dorian Finney-Smith is 4-for-4 from 3 and leads Nets with 16 pts"
"Bulls trail 59-58 at the half.

They erased a 10-point lead midway through the second quarter, but still struggling with consistency on offense.

One improvement: 9-for-18 shooting from 3-point range."
"Kinda liked that bridge group with Williams and Craig on the floor together with Zach, Vooch and Coby. Felt like a good blend to fuel this 12-0 run."
"#Bulls seem to like shooting on this red court. They're 8-for-15 from 3-pt range, with six different players hitting shots. Started the night 28th in league at 30.2%.

Bulls hit 2 3s in a 12-0 run, putting them up 47-45 over Bkn"
"When DeMar DeRozan hit the ground, he reached for his right thigh, which was the injury that bothered him for much of last season. No trainer, though, he returned to bench. #Bulls trail Nets 45-35 mid 2ndQ"
Bulls coaches just like us fr pic.twitter.com/8GkNrv6Viv
"#Bulls didn't play with the kind of intensity needed to win games in the In-Season Tournament. But they're only down 35-30 after 1stQ. DeRozan leads with 9 pts, Nets shot 60.9% from field."
We are streaming tonight on the @Audacy app. and of course @670TheScore  Radio is very much alive and well.
"Torrey Craig hit a 3 on the first possession, but #Bulls are losing the running game to Brooklyn so far. Nets 7-for-10 from the field, on pace to score about 160, leading 17-12 at 7:28 mark of 1stQ"
"Torrey Craig starts in place of Patrick Williams in the sixth game of the Bulls’ season tonight against Brooklyn.

Williams’ place in the rotation was a major topic of discussion in Bulls coach Billy Donovan’s pregame interview."
Torrey Craig hits a 3-pointer for the first Bulls points of the night.
