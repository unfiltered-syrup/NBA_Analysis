"The Atlanta Hawks were below average in both TS% and eFG% last season. This season, they have started out in the top ten in both categories (6th and 8th). Also, seventh in Net Rating. Boom. nba.com/stats/teams/adâ€¦ pic.twitter.com/djVeNTbfBN"

"Trae, on the wraparound pass:

""I'm never looking at the guy that's guarding me.""

Said he is looking for the defender who is helping the helper. pic.twitter.com/yE7qVFD1em"

"When asked about how the Hawks were able to play well on the glass, Quin Snyder replied, ""We did?""

Then (while smirking) took his copy of the stat sheet and nudged it from table to floor."
"Quin Snyder can be evasive or generic at times when responding to specific questions, but when the topic of starters/rotations comes up, he makes a point to clarify that those things will be in flux for the time being."
Snyder pointed to the MIN game as proof that they can handle pressure and play cleanly (8 TOs) but said they were not precise tonight vs. WAS.
"Snyder: ""The fourth quarter, we didn't execute the way that we wanted to."""
"FINAL: Hawks 130, Wizards 121"

Dejounte Murray steal -> windmill dunk
Good night for the Hawks backcourt so far. pic.twitter.com/lpDerdzEiU
Wizards' Jordan Poole just went to the locker room
All five Hawks starters are in double figures with 7:14 left in 3Q.
"HALF: Hawks 59, Wizards 51"
Trae Young gets T'd up
Young finds Dejounte Murray on the wing wrapping the pass around a couple Wizards defenders. Murray hits the 3
Trae throws an inside-out pass to Dejounte at the opposite 3-point elbow and immediately gets into a googles gesture when Murray hit the shot.
"De'Andre Hunter sees mismatch w/ Johnny Davis and posts him up a bit before making the jumper and gets the 3-pt play.

Then Young finds Capela with the lob and he finishes."
I think this game is drunk...
Hunter steal leads to a 1-handed DJM transition dunk out of the time out.
7 turnovers for the Hawks.
"1Q; Wizards 30, Hawks 25"
"Bogi gets in the passing lane, picks off the pass and hits a transition bucket and picks up the and-1."
Rough one for Hunter to this point. Just got a 2nd foul early and AJ Griffin subs in for him.
"When Poole made a corner 3, he said a few things to the Hawks bench and Dejounte seemed none too pleased about that fact on the ensuing trip down the floor."
Wizards have gotten very good looks on 1st four possessions.
Dejounte Murray still hot from Monday night. Hits a 3 on the Hawks' opening possession.

"Way back when, Mike Muscala said that Danny Ferry took his pic off the hallway with all of the players' posters because his shooting form was bad in it.

Muscala's poster went back up after some developmental work to change his shooting form. It has been immaculate ever since."
