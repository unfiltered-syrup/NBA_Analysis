Is IU Football Really going to do this?? I will be sooooo annoying talking about bowl eligibility this week.
"Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Smith remain on the Pacers’ injury report, questionable for tonight v Hornets.

It’s their first back-to-back of the season."
"Rick Carlisle wore a red sweater for pre-game intros as a tribute to Bob Knight. He later shared stories, including from the time he visited IU during the ‘99 lockout.

“…It was one of the most interesting basketball discussions in my entire life.”

"On the Pacers’ capturing the very first in-season tournament win, how both teams approached it, overcoming a slick new court (was it like that everywhere, they wondered) and other notes from Pacers-Cavs.

"NEW: Friday's Pacers game was about responding well against a divisional foe after getting ""bludgeoned"" by Boston.

Inside Game 1 of the in-season tournament, the aqua blue slippery court, Haliburton fighting through offensive woes and Turner's big night.

"Rick Carlisle dropped another saying for the list. On Nesmith:

""In that period at the end of the third quarter, when it was hard to hit a bull in the ass with a bass fiddle, he got the ball in the hole a couple times.""

A quick Google search shows he said the same thing in 2016."
"Players were hesitant to acknowledge it at first postgame, but there was plenty of slippage on the court. Haliburton wondered if it was happening elsewhere with the new courts.

Nonetheless, they fought through it, responded well to a loss + made a late run to get the win. pic.twitter.com/D1DNygl4Jj"
"Want more Bob Knight stories? Here's a conversation with longtime Purdue assistant Bruce Weber, @BillBenner and myself, hosted by @AlanKarpick. Worth a listen if I don't say so myself.

"""I thought the first half was one of the best we played all year,"" Rick Carlisle says postgame. ""It was a strong show of character for our team."""
Quick recap from an impressive Pacers win: si.com/nba/pacers/sch…
"Pacers beat the Cavaliers 121-116. Awful third quarter from Indiana, but they overcome it to win. They're 3-2 on the season and 1-0 in the In-Season tournament.

Even on an off shooting night from Haliburton, the Pacers found a way. 17 for Turner and 19 for Brown. They were huge."
"Pacers beat the Cavs 121-116 for a 1-0 start to Group Play in the IST.

Donovan Mitchell (38-5-9) was so good, but the Pacers used a 12-1 run to take back the lead late — then Haliburton sealed the win again.

He had 18/13a. Turner with 27/9 + a key block late.

Next: Sat. v CHA."
Really weird foul call on Aaron Nesmith there and Donovan Mitchell gets three foul shots. Not done here yet.
"In-Season tournament or not, the atmosphere of this crowd has been absolutely fantastic."
Tyrese Haliburton gets Jarrett Allen on a switch and does his thing. The rest of his game never matters. He's as reliable as they come in the clutch. Pacers up 117-114 with 16.5 to go.
"An impressive shot by Haliburton over Allen after a switch — with a toe on the line.

On a night he's been off, he hit a big one. Pacers up 3 with 16.5s left."
Tyrese Haliburton to Buddy Hield. Seen that one thousands of times. Pacers up 7.
"I think Carlisle wanted to challenge that foul on Myles Turner, but they only have two timeouts with 4:08 to go.

Pacers were on a 9-0 run."
Huge 7-0 run from the Pacers gets the crowd really into it. Some needed defensive stops. 108-105 and we've reached clutch time.
"Everyone getting involved for the Cavs; top 7 players are all in double figures. Mitchell (31) has such a hot hand that he made from 35ft after a timeout was called.

Wonder how much the ankle + groin is bothering Haliburton; he doesn't look as sure of himself offensively."
"Carlisle going back to the starters out of his timeout with 9:22 to go. First play was for Turner (24pts) in the post. Unsuccessfully.

They need to change the game here defensively."
"Pacers were just 8 for 22 with six turnovers and zero FTs in the 3Q, outscored by 16.

Their lead is 1 as the Cavs are setting the tempo once again — outscoring the Pacers at their own game 22-11. Mitchell has 28pts."
88-87 Pacers after three. They blew their lead quickly in that frame and lead by 1 heading into winning time. This stretch to start the frame will be important.
"And now the Cavs have the lead, 85-84, after trailing by 17 at the break.

Their first lead of the game."
"And now the Cavs have the lead, 85-85, after trailing by 17 at the break.

Their first lead of the game."
Pacers 17-point halftime lead is gone.

"Cavs are now within two with 4:25 left in the 3rd, outscoring the Pacers 24-9 in the quarter.

Pacers haven't been able to slow Mitchell, who has 28."
"All Cavs to start the second half, who have already halved the Pacers lead. Donovan Mitchell has been a tough cover."
This is the best view of the court. Shoutout to the sky deck. pic.twitter.com/i7S3XeWu1X
"Great response by the Pacers after getting blown out, having an ""embarrassing"" performance in Boston. Up 70-53 at half.

Turner, who likes this matchup, is 4/4 from deep with 22pts. Haliburton trying to find his off. rhythm (6pts) but has 8a.

Mitchell leads the Cavs with 20."
"Pacers lead 70-53 at the half. Really impressive 24 minutes for the team on both ends. 22 points for Turner, 8 assists for Haliburton."
"A delay of game AND a technical foul on the Cavs. Double whammy, and it's their second tech. Free points for the Pacers."
Myles Turner having an unbelievable night. 22 points (and couting) on just 8 shots so far. Excellent defense. 5 rebounds. 2 steal. Dominating the Cavs.
"Wow. A Haliburton to Toppin alley-ooop in transition, a long-awaited play. It went as expected."
"The Cavs continue to leave Turner open on the perimeter and he's taking advantage. 3 for 3 from range and up to a game-high 17pts.

Pacers maintaining their double-digit lead despite their high turnover rate."
"Really awesome defense from Myles Turner containing Garland on a switch. Turner's best defensive game of the season so far, for my money."
"Mathurin's vision and passing are much improved this season. He used to put his head down and attack, attack. Learning to play within the flow of the offense.

He averaged 1.5a per game last season. Already has four tonight in 10mins."
"Pacers up 36-26 after one quarter, by far their best start of a game so far this season. They defended pretty well and made 5 threes, as many as they made on Wednesday night.

Buddy Hield leads with 8 points."
"Good read by Mathurin to give it to Jalen Smith in the post. Smith then had success against LeVert and scored.

Best 1Q of the season by the Pacers, up 36-26.

Their five made 3s matches their total output Wednesday in Boston."
Buddy Hield's passing this season has been so good. Out of nowhere skill improvement.
"Pacers off to a quick start against the Cavs. They've made four 3s, including one from Buddy Hield on a BLOB immediately after checking in. Haliburton still trying to find his rhythm.

Both Turner and Brown have 7pts."
